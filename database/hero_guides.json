        "guide": "Tips\nBlink into the trees! If you're getting ganked, always assume that there is someone behind you, waiting for you to Blink back into the lane/jungle to retreat. You have a stupid low cooldown on Blink. Blink into an isolated patch of trees, then watch four heroes suddenly materialize from the fog struggling to find you, then quietly continue Blinking along the treeline until you're sure you're safe. Chances are you'll have a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury to cut down trees and walk your way out anyway.\nCounterspell prevents single targeted spells from affecting you and it reflects the spell back at the original caster. All Linken's and Lotus Orb interactions are consistent with Counterspell's behavior. There are a few unique interactions to note, however:\nCertain spells can only be reflected by Counterspell on cast and don't do anything on projectile impact. Notable examples include Dazzle's Poison Touch and Grimstroke's Phantom's Embrace.\nRiki's Blink Strike and Phantom Assassin's Phantom Strike will be 'absorbed' by Counterspell. So their spell will go on cooldown and they won't come to you, but you won't reflect back to them.\n'Bouncing' spells can't be reflected unless you're the primary target, but Counterspell will still allow you to ignore a few of them once they bounce to you. Notable examples include Bounty Hunter's Shuriken Toss, Medusa's Mystic Snake, and Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask.\nSome AoE spells can be reflected by Counterspell if you are in the AoE. Notable examples include Alchemist's Unstable Concoction, Lion's Earth Spike, and Sand King's Burrowstrike. Note that Burrowstrike will make you swap positions with Sand King if you Counterspell him.\nIf you attack a target that's Bane Nightmared with Counterspell on, you'll take it off the target and the enemy Bane will get Nightmared instead of you. Since you're considered the 'owner' of the Nightmare, you're also allowed to attack Bane without the Nightmare getting dispelled. Pretty funny.\nIf Tiny Tossed you in the air on yourself and he's still standing next to you when you hit the ground, activating Counterspell will Toss him up in the air.\nLinken's Sphere will only trigger on your hero if Counterspell's shield isn't active.\nRather than trying to perfectly time Counterspell when a projectile hits you, just force the issue. If you're escaping from an enemy who you think is trying to cast a spell on you, take them by surprise by walking towards them with Counterspell on and they may fire their spell straight into your shield.\nLeft click on an enemy hero to check their mana pool before Mana Voiding them. You may be able to get a kill without doing any right clicking if you show up at the right time.\nMana Break plays a slightly higher pitched sound on attacks when targets are below 50% of their max mana.\nWhile it's often tempting to spend Mana Void as a baller finishing move on a pick-off target, know that it's really not meant to be used like an Axe Culling Blade in the late game. The AoE damage can be significant when used on a out-of-mana target with a large mana pool and you never know if you may need the stun to cancel an enemy channel.\nThat being said, it's okay for you to steal kills with Mana Void in the early/mid game. You do more with the gold than anyone else at that stage. The typical Anti-Mage team fight contribution is a two way street.\nMana Void stuns everything in the AoE. If you're trying to stun an enemy who has a Linken's Sphere, consider Mana Voiding a creep next to them to bypass Linken's and stun them.\nIf you ground target Agh's Scepter Blink Fragment from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nThis is useless information, but the bonus damage from the passive Quell of Quelling Blade stacks with Battle Fury. Now that I mention it, the active also stacks and doesn't share a cooldown with Battle Fury allowing you to cut double the trees!\nAn excellent hero to practice learning Tread switching on. Get in the rhythm of always tapping your Treads to INT before Blinking and then immediately turning them back to AGI. You'd be surprised at how much mana you save.\nCounters\nShadow Demon is a notable counter against AM since the illusions created by Disruption will Mana Break him. Dark Seer's Wall of Replica and Terrorblade's Reflection are also ways to create illusions of an enemy Anti-Mage.\nTry not to stack disables when ganking AM. Stuns and silences are invaluable when you're trying to kill him, but you need to stagger them appropriately, otherwise he'll blink out.\nThe best players will not only stagger disables, but wait for the middle of AM's 0.4s cast animation on Blink to disable him.\nRoots/leashes prevent Anti-Mage from casting Blink.\nWatch his Blink animation to determine the direction that he Blinks in. The particle 'trail' always floats in the direction that he traveled.\nHarpoon's active is undisjointable. If you're trying to catch an escaping Anti-Mage, try timing Harpoon during his Blink animation and the projectile will follow and drag him right back to you. This is less reliable in melee range because you need the Blink to happen before the Harpoon projectile connects.\nTry baiting Counterspell by canceling cast animations of single targeted spells. The Counterspell buff doesn't last that long and skittish Anti-Mages may be too trigger happy with activating the shield. Same concept as baiting an enemy Slark into casting Dark Pact too early.\nAM's Mana Break passive and magic resistance from Counterspell's passive can be broken by Silver Edge and other sources of Break.\nCounterspell's active can be dispelled. Not really too useful since most dispels are targeted spells that'll get blocked by Counterspell anyway, but handy to know with Nullifier or Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge.\nA Ghost Scepter can save your life in the late game as a support.\nDon't stand near allies who are out of mana in the late game. They're a mana bomb waiting for AM to Mana Void detonate their ass."

        "name": "Axe",
        "guide": "Tips\nRemember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro. Don't waste mana on Berserker's Call if you don't have to.\nYou can even use the top bar portraits to draw aggro. If you see an enemy hero is in vision on your minimap, you can attack+move (default A+left click) the enemy top bar portrait and it'll issue an attack command which'll draw creep aggro without having to move your camera.\nEnemies will follow you around when taunted in Berserker's Call. If you value positioning more than damage, you can walk or Force Staff after a Call to shepherd taunted enemies in your direction.\nBerserker's Call goes through debuff immunity. If you see a BKB'd Shadow Fiend wiggling around trying to cast his Requiem, just walk up and Q him to interrupt it.\nBerserker's Call's taunt is undispellable, even by strong dispels like Legion Commander's Press the Attack or Tidehunter's Kraken Shell.\nBerserker's Call is a handy way to interrupt an enemy's invisibility. If an enemy Clinkz just ran away with 10 HP, try Blinking into where you think he'll be and cast Call. If you're right, they'll be forced to attack you and lose their invis.\nJust because you don't catch anyone in Berserker's Call doesn't mean the spell was a bust. You get massive armor during its duration which can sometimes make the difference between life and death.\nRemember that Battle Hunger DPS scales off your armor. So if an enemy is close to death from Battle Hunger, try casting a Berserker's Call on nothing just to give yourself more armor.\nThe successful kill buff from Culling Blade also temporarily boosts your armor significantly. It's probably rarely practical, but you could Cull some nearby creep to increase your armor and raise your Battle Hunger DPS if an enemy is close to ticking out but out of range to get Culled themselves.\nBattle Hunger deals physical damage which means it is amplified with minus armor and can damage debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nBattle Hunger is a great spell for disabling Blink Daggers, especially when breaking high ground.\nBattle Hunger is a great spell for annoying supports in lane. Either they have to steal a last hit from their carry and get raged at or they panic over denies and miss them anyway.\nWhen jungling a camp with Hill Trolls, focus your right clicks on the little shield Trolls bastards because they Break you and prevent you from lowering the Counter Helix count.\nCounter Helix will trigger on most instant attacks like from Clinkz's Burning Barrage, Pangolier's Swashbuckle, or Riki's Tricks of the Trade.\nInstant attacks that cannot proc attack modifiers, like Gyro's Flak Cannon, will not trigger Counter Helix.\nCounter Helix will not trigger on attacks from towers or wards (like Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards or Venomancer's Plague Wards).\nYou can Cull any enemy unit, including creeps. While this is usually irrelevant, it can potentially be worth Culling a creep to get the AoE movement speed buff to catch up to or escape from an enemy.\nCulling Blade can kill through Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's False Promise, Abaddon's Borrowed Time, and Troll Warlord's Battle Trance. Culling Blade don't care.\nCulling Blade can be used as a finishing blow on Rosh in high pressure fights. Just be aware that killing Rosh won't reset the cooldown.\nYou can instagib couriers with Culling Blade.\nYou get permanent Culling Blade stacks off of Aegis kills or Wraith King Reincarnation kills.\nAxe has one of the highest base HP regen stats in the game. This makes creep cutting a very effective strategy during the laning phase if the enemy team doesn't have any heroes who can deal with you from a distance.\nCounters\nBattle Hunger can be taken off by denies. If your lane mate is being a hungry hungry hippo with last hits, focus your energy on landing a deny.\nBattle Hunger only slows you if your hero is facing away from Axe.\nWhen trying to help an ally who is about to die to Axe in lane, don't toss a few measly auto attacks if Axe isn't close to death himself. Axe will gladly trade some damage if it means he gets a few more chances to Helix.\nYou can click on Axe and check his buffs to see how many attacks are left before his next Counter Helix spin.\nIf you have a Eul's Scepter and have vision of an enemy initiator, like Axe, keep casting and canceling cyclone on them if you think a team fight is about to break out. Cyclone has 0 cast time and the moment your target comes into range (like with a Blink Dagger), the cyclone will instantly get cast.\nIf you somehow manage to steal an enemy hero's items when they drop them on the ground, you should store them somewhere safe on your side of the map instead of destroying them. A destroyed item or a stolen item in your inventory won't count towards an enemy's net worth, but an item on the ground does. This means you'll get more gold per kill, they'll lose more gold per death, and their buyback will cost more since the grounded item is still factored into their net worth.\nBy extension, if you're about to win the game and the enemy courier starts flying out and dropping items on you, don't take the bait. They're hoping you kill the items and lower their net worth so their buy back will cost less.\nWhy is this listed as a counter to Axe? Because I wanted to note this tip down somewhere and back in the day Axes used to get their boots stolen a lot. You had to be there."

        "name": "Bane",
        "guide": "Tips\nEnfeeble reduces enemy cast range on items in addition to spells.\nBrain Sap heals you for the same amount of damage you deal to a target. This means if you Brain Sap an illusion, you heal a ton because of the illusion damage multiplier.\nBrain Sap fully pierces debuff immunity/BKB.\nNo one seems to know how Nightmare works, so let me learn you something. For the first second of the Nightmare the unit is completely invulnerable, similar to Naga Song sleep. If anyone besides Bane right clicks this hero after the first second, the Nightmare will be transferred to them. However, if any damaging spells are used on the hero, they'll instantly wake up, take the damage, and the Nightmare will be dispelled.\nBane can damage Nightmared units with spells, items, or attacks without waking them.\nNightmared targets can get hit by Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist, Kunkka's Tidebringer, or Phantom Assassin's Stifling Dagger and still not wake up for some reason.\nYou can use the first second of invulnerability on Nightmare to protect yourself or an ally from being affected by any incoming projectiles or damaging/debuffing spells.\nDebuff immune targets also receive the invulnerability period. So if you Nightmare a BKB'd ally (or enemy), they can even briefly act in a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Enigma Black Hole.\nIf you have an active Nightmare out, you can dispel all other active Nightmares with Nightmare End, including reflected Lotus Nightmares or Rubick Nightmares.\nHowever, you cannot use Nightmare End if Anti-Mage Counterspells your Nightmare. This is because you don't 'own' any of the Nightmares that are out. Be very careful when trying to Nightmare an Anti-Mage.\nYou can cast Nightmare End without interrupting channels, like during Fiend's Grip or TPs. You can even cast Nightmare End while you're stunned.\nTowers completely ignore creeps that are Nightmared. Consider Nightmaring an allied creep during a push to keep it alive whenever the enemy team uses Glyph.\nYou can try using Nightmare to save a siege creep that's about to go on a solo mission straight into an enemy tower.\nCreeps completely ignore Nightmared targets. If an enemy hero is try to cut creep waves, putting them to sleep will get your creeps back on track to the lane.\nCasting Fiend's Grip on an enemy will end Nightmare.\nLike all other heroes with channeled ults, you can cast Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade/Glimmer Cape to go invis during the Fiend's Grip channel.\nFiend's Grip provides true sight on the target for the full duration of the channel.\nFiend's Grip can be used to stun couriers, but won't damage them.\nBane has 1200 night vision. This is higher than the typical 800 night vision that most heroes have.\nCounters\nTAKE THE NIGHTMARE OFF YOUR ALLIES. If they're Nightmared out of position, take it off them and slowly migrate the Nightmare to safer territory. To transfer a Nightmare, attempt to deny your Nightmared ally.\nWhenever Nightmare is transferred, the new target will be slept for the full Nightmare duration again.\nIf you're debuff immune/BKB'd consider taking Nightmare off an ally (or enemy). The Nightmare debuff will be transferred to you, but chances are someone besides Bane will damage you and dispel the Nightmare. What's even better is if an enemy besides Bane tries to right click you, they'll get Nightmared.\nUse summons to take the Nightmare off allies or yourself when possible. Beastmaster Boars, Lycan Wolves, Brood Spiderlings, Nature's Prophet Treants, or illusions are all great sacrificial lambs to remove the Nightmare.\nFiend's Grip is no joke as a disable. Save stuns and silences to stop the channel on Bane's ult.\nOr save strong dispels. Things like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, and Oracle's False Promise can dispel Bane's ult off your allies.\nDisruptor's Glimpse is a long range and convenient way to cancel Fiend's Grip.\nLotus Orb prevents Bane from casting Fiend's Grip on a target without it getting canceled instantly.\nLotus Orb has an interesting interaction with Nightmare. If you attempt to take Nightmare off a target while you have an active Lotus Orb on your hero, the Nightmare will transfer to you and also apply a Nightmare to Bane. Most of the time this isn't useful since Bane can end Nightmares and get out of the disable, but if he's in the middle of a Fiend's Grip channel, you could potentially interrupt it using this mechanic.\nRubick is a common counter to Bane since Fiend's Grip is a guaranteed steal, but Nightmare also has an interesting interaction with Rubick. If Bane and Rubick both have a Nightmare out, anyone who casts the Nightmare End sub-spell will end all active Nightmares."

        "name": "Bloodseeker",
        "guide": "Tips\nBloodrage can be cast on creep-hero units like Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.\nBloodrage's spell amplification increases damage done by items as well.\nBlood Rite provides ground vision around its AoE.\nThirst heals you based on the max HP of the killed unit.\nEnemies can't easily use Blink Dagger if they're Ruptured. It has a pretty long cast range and the debuff lasts a ridiculously long time, so it can be useful to mess with Blinks from an initiator like Tidehunter or Magnus before a team fight begins.\nAgh's Scepter Blood Mist can be toggled while channeling TPs.\nIf you take the \"2 Rupture charges\" talent, be aware that multiple casts of Rupture don't stack on the same target, it'll just refresh the duration. What'd you expect, they'll bleed twice as hard? C'mon now.\nCounters\nTP scroll. Seriously. Just TP out if he's ganking you. None of his spells have stuns/roots/leashes to cancel it.\nIf you can exceed more than 1300 range in one server tick, Rupture won't damage you. This is why you don't take damage from Rupture after TPing back to base, but this is also relevant if you're playing Queen of Pain (move immediately after Blinking max range and you won't take Rupture damage) or have cast range increasing abilities on Blink Dagger.\nSpirit Vessel is so outrageously value against a BS, it's not even funny. Vessel him before he heals off a target dying and watch him struggle to stay alive in team fights. Skadi and Shiva's can also prevent him from healing as much.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing, such as from Thirst.\nBlade Mail can be good if you're tanky, especially if he Ruptures you.\nLotus Orb can provide a lot of value when placed on your carry since BS will feel uneasy about initiating a team fight with Rupture.\nKiss juking goodbye if there's a Bloodseeker on the enemy team. Once a match you'll find yourself wondering, \"HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS THERE???\" Then you'll look up and realize that Bloodseeker was giving his team global vision of your ass when you're under 25% HP thanks to his Thirst passive.\nThirst vision provides true sight as well. Not even invisibility will save you at critical HP.\nBe extremely careful when jungling at low HP against an enemy Bloodseeker. If he detects you with Thirst vision, you can be sure that his whole team will be quickly converging on your location to score a kill.\nIf Bloodseeker has an Agh's Scepter, the overheal barrier can be dispelled off with spells like Enchantress's Enchant, Oracle's Fortune's End, Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge, or items like Nullifier or Eul's Scepter.\nMjollnir's Static Shield active has a chance to proc off any damage instance applied to your hero. This includes damage instances from spells. Since Agh's Scepter Blood Mist ticks damage extremely frequently, it can be a sneaky way to deal damage against Bloodseeker lineups."

        "name": "Crystal Maiden",
        "guide": "Tips\nCrystal Nova provides vision around the target radius for ~6 seconds. Useful when trying to deward or scout the Rosh pit.\nThe vision radius is also waaaay bigger than the actual spell's damage radius (900 ground vision), so you can use it to scout across treelines, help get vision of an escaping enemy at night, cast it on high ground if an enemy is going up stairs, or keep track of enemy movement during a tier 3 push after your creep wave dies.\nFrostbite lasts for 10 seconds on creeps and will do 100 DPS at all levels (WOW THAT'S LIKE 1000 DAMAGE). This allows you to grab some easy XP or ward money from a large neutral camp as one Frostbite+some auto attacks will usually be enough to kill the biggest creep in the camp. Just do your team a favor and try to finish the whole camp, though. No one wants your leftovers.\nTry to drag the big creep out of the camp before Frostbiting them. This way you won't draw aggro from the other creeps while you're beating on the big one.\nAgh's Shard Crystal Clone disjoints incoming projectiles.\nYou can use the pushback on Agh's Shard Crystal Clone to travel up and down cliffs.\nYou can cast Agh's Shard Crystal Clone while channeling. Like channeling Freezing Field or a TP.\nYou can detonate your own Agh's Shard Crystal Clone by damaging it with your AoE spells like Crystal Nova or Freezing Field.\nFreezing Field has some logic to how its damage is determined. Basically the AoE circle of the spell is divided into quadrants and each quadrant is cycled through counterclockwise every 0.1s with the northeast quadrant being the first one. In theory, the most reliable way to damage an enemy is to have them standing directly in a cardinal direction from your hero so that they're on the line between two quadrants. In practice, this doesn't consistently make that big a difference. Overall, it's just a pretty random spell.\nIf you're going Battle Maiden, one item of choice is Shadow Blade/Shadow Amulet/Glimmer Cape since you can cast the invis while you're channeling your Freezing Field. BKB is also a nice luxury option.\nBoots of Bearing, Disperser from allies, and Dark Seer's Surge can allow you to temporarily bypass the move speed slow when casting Agh's Scepter Freezing Field.\nA good Freezing Field can often make or break a team fight. You don't have to blow the spell as soon as the fight breaks out (unless you want to force the enemy to use their disables on a support). Casting your ultimate when the enemy has forgotten about you and once disables are on cooldown could be the key to success.\nCounters\nDon't underestimate her early game spell damage. If you don't have any stuns/silences, her ult will destroy you in a 1v1 support cage match.\nFrostbite is a root which will disable most movement spells (and obviously Blink Dagger). If you're an Anti-Mage or Queen of Pain and CM is sauntering towards you, you can be sure that she has backup.\nIn matches against CM you'll often find yourself wondering, \"How does X have so much mana!?\" CM's Arcane Aura is why they have so much mana. So don't assume that just because Ancient Apparition used Chilling Touch 3 times at level 2 that he's going to stop any time soon.\nA lot of things that you'd think would stop an Agh's Scepter Freezing Field don't. Axe's Berserker's Call, Disruptor's Glimpse, Kunkka's X Marks The Spot, and Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap, will no longer cancel Freezing Field after CM gets an Agh's Scepter."

        "name": "Drow Ranger",
        "guide": "Tips\nManually casting Frost Arrows on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.\nThe knockback on Gust doesn't break item channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.\nHowever, the Gust knockback does move enemies, making it cancel things like Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge, Templar Assassin's Meld, and enemies in Shadow Amulet.\nGust reveals invisible enemy units for the duration of the silence.\nGust's self move speed bonus works even if you don't hit anything. If you need to make a quick escape, just use it on nothing and start running.\nBeware that Gust knockback can potentially push enemies out of a teammate Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Slark's Pounce leash.\nEnemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Gust). If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nMultishot gives a small amount of flying vision over the projectiles.\nMultishot scales off your base damage. It does not multiply 'green' +dmg.\nDespite its appearance, Multishot is not an instant attack. Therefore, the arrows do not apply attack modifiers (other than Frost Arrows), the spell won't break enemy Tranquil Boots, and it won't remove a Smoke buff off your hero if an attack lands on a target.\nYou can use Marksmanship's particle effect and buff disappearing to detect if invis heroes are hugging you.\nMarksmanship procs have true strike. Not only will the Marksmanship damage go through, but so does your right click damage. This provides a built-in counter to evasion heroes.\nWhile Marksmanship does add a buff to creep-heroes (like Visage's Familiars), they can't benefit from the AGI in any way.\nWhile standing on Agh's Shard Glacier, Marksmanship won't be disabled by nearby enemies.\nYou can activate Agh's Shard Glacier while in the middle of channeling Multishot and it won't cancel it, but you won't get the bonus arrows.\nEven melee heroes can benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Agh's Shard Glacier.\nAll units benefit from the bonus attack range when standing on Glacier. Including enemies.\nAgh's Shard Glacier basically gives Drow a really short duration free pathing buff similar to Spectre's Spectral Dagger. The intention is to let you walk off the front of the Glacier, but if you line the Glacier up with a cliff, you can walk over walls too.\nStanding on Agh's Shard Glacier is like standing on two 'levels' of high ground in terms of how vision works. To get vision of you, the enemy would need to have a ward or hero that's two ramps/stairs higher than you, similar to seeing a Monkey King that's perched on a tree.\nBe aware that attacking any enemy gives vision of your hero. So if you're using Glacier to hide/escape, don't attack anything.\nMost sources of accuracy won't work when attacking buildings, but Agh's Shard Glacier does. If you're sieging an enemy high ground tower, you won't miss any attacks on it from low ground if you're standing on Glacier.\nNullifier can dispel the Force Staff buff off heroes. However, it does not dispel the Hurricane Pike pushback buff. If you're trying to escape while Nullified, casting Pike on yourself won't work to create a gap, but Piking an enemy will.\nCounters\nGet in her face. There is nothing Drows hate more than someone in melee range of her. She loses the bonuses from Marksmanship if enemy heroes are close to her, so try closing the distance even if you're a ranged hero.\nIllusions won't disable Marksmanship, only actual heroes.\nDrow is a ranged hero so Halberd's disarm lasts longer on her.\nMarksmanship procs bypass your hero's main armor, but not bonus armor. This means that armor gained from agility won't help you very much against her, but raw armor items can be quite useful.\nAgh's Scepter Hypothermia stacks can be dispelled.\nIt doesn't matter whose team the Agh's Shard Glacier belongs to, any unit standing on it gets bonus attack range."

        "name": "Earthshaker",
        "guide": "Tips\nIn most situations, the block on Fissure is more valuable than the stun itself. So if you're trying to throw out a Fissure from long range, lead it ahead more than you want to. If you don't land the stun, it's a minor inconvenience. Separating your team from your target, that's a major inconvenience.\nIf you're trying to milk your stun time for as long as possible, don't mash all your spells at once. You can squeeze in about one auto-attack's worth of time in between casts once Aftershock is maxed.\nIf you feel a fight coming on, prime up an Enchant Totem if you have the mana to spare. The duration is long, so you should be able to walk in with one Enchanted Totem and pull out another one during the fight.\nWith Agh's Shard, Aftershock applies to the Fissure globally. You don't have to be anywhere near the Fissure to get it to resonate Aftershocks from an Enchant Totem. If there's a Fissure still lingering around in the middle of a fight, try to stun off that to catch enemies by surprise.\nWith Agh's Shard, the Aftershock on Fissure stacks with the Aftershock your hero has. When free farming a creep wave, you should walk in the middle of the wave before Fissuring to get the damage from both Aftershocks.\nYou can travel up and down cliffs with Agh's Shard by casting Fissure and walking through it.\nEcho Slam works fully on invisible units.\nEcho Slam has zero cast animation. As long as you're not disabled, you should always be able to get it off.\nCounters\n\"Hey guys don\u2019t clump, I think Shaker has blink da... Yeah... he does.\"\nClockwerk makes life difficult for Earthshaker since Battery Assault cancels most of his cast animations.\nAftershock won't trigger if Earthshaker is under a Break debuff.\nRooting Earthshaker will prevent his ability to jump away with Agh's Scepter Enchant Totem."

        "name": "Juggernaut",
        "guide": "Tips\nYou can activate Blade Fury while TPing and your channel won't break. Use this to go debuff immune if someone is walking up to you while you're TPing or use it to show up to your destination pre-debuff immune.\nDebuff immunity, like from Blade Fury, prevents Tormentor damage from reflecting on you.\nIf you right click an enemy unit during Blade Fury, you'll \"attack\" them, but not in the traditional sense. The mechanics behind these right click attacks performed during Blade Fury:\nThey will not deal damage to heroes.\nThey will not cleave or lifesteal.\nThey will apply/refresh on-hit effects like Orb of Venom or Desolator.\nThey will roll for proc chances on items like Basher or Maelstrom.\nThey will deal damage to towers.\nThey will add to 'hero attacks' for ward-type units (Pugna's Nether Ward, Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards, Phoenix's Supernova, Undying's Tombstone).\nThey will deal damage to couriers.\nBlade Fury DPS scales off your current attack speed and updates dynamically.\nYou can Blade Fury into a Black Hole or Chronosphere without it getting canceled. You'll still get disabled, though.\nIf you're extremely fast fingered, you can cast Blade Fury during Manta Style's banishment to get out of ground targeted silences like Riki's Smoke Screen and Disruptor's Static Storm. It's hard as hell to do, but you may have luck if you just mash both the Blade Fury hotkey and your Manta hotkey at the same time.\nRather than frantically clicking around an enemy while attempting to Blade Fury them, use a follow command (default M+left click) on the target hero. This makes you far more difficult to juke and takes the guesswork out of following the enemy. Just beware if the enemy is about to go into fog because that will cancel the follow.\nIf you hold down ALT while mashing the Blade Fury hotkey, you can make Juggernaut scream on demand. Core knowledge in the laning phase, tbh.\nJughead is a competent solo pusher with the staying power that the Healing Ward gives creeps.\nHealing Ward gives a fair amount of ground vision making it a clever tool for scouting if you don't need the heal. Use it to scout Rosh, check uphill, or give vision on cliffs for counterwarding.\nTo get your Healing Ward to stick on an ally, select the Ward and then right click the ally you want it to follow or use a move command (default 'M'+left click).\nWhile mid-Omnislash, you can cast spells (except Blade Fury) and use items (except TPs and Blink Dagger).\nAs soon as you get your ultimate, constantly be looking for good opportunities to Omnislash. A good way to create one is to quickly kill the enemy's creep wave and then pounce on them while they're wondering why you got four last hits and they have yet to get one. The lane push will be worth the kill.\nOnly the first hit of Omnislash can be blocked by Linken's Sphere. The rest of the bounces will continue and deal damage as expected.\nOmnislash damage works through disarms.\nCasting Omnislash applies a basic dispel on Jugg.\nMechanically, Agh's Scepter Swiftslash follows all the same notes and rules as Omnislash.\nCounters\nGoing Ethereal (from Ghost Scepter, Necrophos's Ghost Shroud, Pugna's Decrepify, etc.) protects you from damage received during Omnislash. Eul's Scepter can also be used to momentarily evade Omni damage.\nKeep tabs on Jugg's mana in lane. Blade Fury and/or Omnislash are usually free kills if Jugg has the mana to cast them. It also means that he can't escape easily if he doesn't have the mana to cast Blade Fury.\nHOLY PEACHES, PLEASE KILL THE HEALING WARD. It takes 1 attack. Doesn't matter if it's a 1k crit from Drow or a love tap from a dominated ranged creep, KILL IT.\nAt early levels, help your teammate diffuse Omnislash damage by running in and tanking some bounces. At late levels, just run away because he'll probably kill you both.\nDUDE I'M SERIOUS, KILL THE HEALING WARD.\nEach Omnislash attack alternates between hitting the front and back of a hero. The first attack is always on the back. You can use this to outplay low level Omnislashes with heroes like Bristleback or Mars by rotating your hero 180 degrees in between slashes to make sure Jugg keeps hitting the reduced side. This is only really useful against early game Omnislash.\nDamage block from items like Vanguard or Crimson Guard can reduce Omnislash damage.\nThe search radius to find the next Omnislash attack is 425 range. If you're able to quickly exceed that distance while you're being solo Omni'd, like with Mirana's Leap or Void Spirit's Astral Step or any spell Blinks, you can potentially escape the Omnislash.\nGoing invisible (if Jugg has no true sight) or banishing yourself will end the Omnislash if there are no other targets for Jugg to jump to."

        "guide": "Tips\nThe second Starstorm hit will land on the closest target to your hero when the spell was cast.\nPrimary Starstorms can't hit units in fog, but the secondary hit searches through fog. If someone's at critical HP and juking in trees, you can safely cast the Starstorm blindly and let the second Starstorm hit get the kill.\nThe idea behind landing consistent Arrows is trying to throw them in a way that gives you a large window to hit a target and a small window for them to notice the Arrow. If you're tossing out Arrows that are 90 degrees opposite your target, you're giving yourself a very small frame for the Arrow to hit. It can be smart to sacrifice some time of the target running to give yourself a more forgiving/parallel angle.\nThe more realistic idea behind landing consistent Arrows is pairing it with other stuns or disables.\nDuring downtime, you can quickly one-shot a big creep in the jungle with a Sacred Arrow for some easy experience and gold. The biggest creeps usually chill in the back of creep camps, so learn how to position yourself accordingly. Just be sure to finish off the rest of the camp so it'll respawn... Unless you're sniping enemy jungle camps, I guess.\nSacred Arrow can also one-shot siege creeps.\nSacred Arrow kills creeps through the Glyph invulnerability.\nSacred Arrow provides flying vision as it travels and lingers for a few seconds wherever it ends.\nYou don't need to hit Sacred Arrow from maximum cast range to get the full stun/damage. It reaches max power at half its full travel distance.\nYou can begin the Sacred Arrow cast animation mid-Leap. This helps in giving an enemy less time to react to you winding up the Arrow.\nThis even works when throwing Arrows backwards when escaping. The best way to do a butt Arrow is to cast Leap and then immediately target Sacred Arrow in front of your Leaping hero, but behind the Leap's finishing point. If done correctly, Mirana will toss the Arrow backwards with a very short animation. You'll just need to practice to make sure you're targeting the right angles.\nWhen escaping, ideally save Leap charges to travel across cliffs or treelines rather than panicking and immediately blowing charges where the enemy can easily follow you.\nCasting Agh's Shard Leap won't break Moonlight Shadow invisibility.\nEvery target debuffed by Agh's Shard Leap will get hit by a secondary Starstorm if they're in the AoE of the initial Starstorm.\nPay attention to the map to see if you can use Moonlight Shadow to help out teammates.\nAlso, pay attention to the map to make sure none of your teammates are in vision when using Moonlight Shadow to be sneaky. If enemies see the crescent moon buff show up over one of your allies for no reason, they'll probably start playing very safe.\nIt's a common tactic to use Smoke of Deceit in combination with Moonlight Shadow. You can take advantage of Smoke's move speed bonus and use the invis fading away on Smoke to know when you're getting close to the enemy while maintaining invis under Moonlight.\nYou can dispel Dust detection (after you walk out of the AoE) with basic dispels, like from Eul's Scepter, Guardian Greaves, Lotus Orb, or Manta Style.\nCounters\nIf there's a Mirana on the enemy team, treat her like a Pudge in the laning phase as far as movement and positioning is concerned. Hug creeps, don't stand still, and get mad at your teammates for being Arrow magnets.\nSometimes you do want to tank Arrows, though. If you feel pretty safe pushing a tower, stand near your siege creep to protect from instantly dying to Sacred Arrow.\nMoonlight Shadow lasts an eternity in Dota time. You really need a ton of sentry wards and Dust whenever you're pushing into a competent team that has a PotM.\nMirana cannot Leap when rooted/leashed.\nUndying's Tombstone zombies can be annoying for Mirana to deal with since they tank Sacred Arrow."

        "guide": "Tips\nTo increase your farm efficiency/speed, consider using Waveform to last hit creeps in one jungle camp while traveling to the next one.\nHowever, neutral tokens won't drop from creeps if you're in Waveform. So if you haven't gotten all your neutral tokens yet, avoid last hitting with Waveform, otherwise the creeps will have a zero percent chance of dropping a neutral token.\nYou're invulnerable during Waveform. You can use this to run head first into spell projectiles like Gyrocopter's Homing Missile to absorb the stun or just dodge any other damage instances while Waveforming.\nThe \"Waveform Attacks Targets\" talent ignores disarms.\nWhen one Adaptive Strike is cast, the other goes on cooldown for 3 seconds.\nAdaptive Strike has a pretty long backswing animation, so be sure to start right clicking or casting something quickly after shooting your water gun.\nYou can toggle Attribute Shift while channeling a TP.\nAlways try to max STR Attribute Shift before picking up a Shield rune since the barrier scales off your HP.\nWhen you're low, Attribute Shifting into full AGI and then shifting back to STR will generate HP out of thin air.\nWhy? Well I know you come to these tips because you don't want to read a lot of things, but if you are willing to spend a little more brain power learning about Dota, I highly recommend studying the following post explaining how HP gain from Attribute Shift can be properly exploited.\nMechanics on Morphs:\nMorphs take the target hero's base STR, AGI, INT, primary attribute, level, range, and move speed on cast. You do not get the hero's base armor, base damage, BAT, projectile speed, or talents.\nMorphs will keep Morphling's items and you can use them normally as the Morphed hero.\nMorphs copy the current percentage of HP/Mana on Morphling when cast.\nIf you Morph into a hero with a new spell granted by Agh's Scepter/Shard, you'll only get it if Morphling has a Scepter/Shard and the enemy has their Scepter/Shard.\nIf you Morph into a hero whose non-ultimate spell gets upgraded by Agh's Scepter/Shard, only Morphling needs the Scepter/Shard to get the upgrade.\nIf you create an alt-cast Agh's Scepter Morph illusion of an enemy, the illusion will copy whatever Scepter/Shard status the enemy hero has. However, the illusion won't be able to cast new spells granted by Scepter, only ones granted by Shard. If you read this tip and it makes sense to you, you just earned your Dota PhD.\nToggling out of a Morph behaves the same way as Rubick's Spell Steal timing out in terms of buffs/spells/summons lingering.\nToggling into an Agh's Scepter Morph illusion effectively 'kills' the illusion and only makes you take its position and copy its cooldowns.\nMorphs spawn with a full set of charges for any charge based spell.\nIf your target hero gets 'new spells' or levels up their own spells, you can refresh your Morph's spells by toggling in and out of the Morph. This is mainly relevant if you Morph an Invoker since you can get new Invoker spells whenever he Invokes them.\nWhen targeting an enemy illusion with Morph, your cast will target and turn into the owner/source of the illusion, not necessarily the hero itself.\nActivating a Manta Style or illusion rune as another hero will generate illusions of that hero and keep them even after morphing back.\nIf you die in Vengeful Spirit's form while you have an Agh's Scepter, you will turn into a Vengeance Aura Venge illusion when you die. You'll also take that illusion's place when you respawn as Morphling.\nBecause the Agh's Scepter Morph illusion can cast spells, it can also channel Watchers and Outposts. It can channel Lotus Pools as well, but the Lotuses don't transfer to your inventory when you take it over. They just disappear into the void.\nIf you generate self-illusions using Naga Siren's Mirror Image or Shadow Demon's Disruption, you can shift+queue Morph (or just hit the hotkey) after casting those spells to create Morphling illusions.\nYou can activate Sand Storm as Sand King and then Morph out but still keep the Sand Storm buff as long as you remain in the AoE.\nActivating Terrorblade's Metamorphosis while Morphed only affects your Morph as Terrorblade. Toggling back to Morphling will remove the Metamorphosis buff and it'll be on cooldown whenever you toggle back into Terrorblade.\nCounters\nMorphling cannot Waveform when rooted.\nYou need to have quick nuke damage if you want to kill Morphling. With STR Attribute Shift, he can usually gain HP faster than you can burn him down with auto attacks or DoTs.\nSpirit Vessel substantially reduces the HP Morphling will gain when STR shifting. As do Skadi and Shiva's.\nIf you die with 0 charges on your Urn/Vessel, you'll be gifted 1 upon death. This is true even if you die to neutrals/Roshan.\nOrb of Corrosion reduces all health restoration on debuffed enemies.\nThe Vhoul Assassin neutral's passive applies a HP regen reduction debuff on enemies. It's a weaker version of the Orb of Corrosion debuff because the Vhoul Envenomed Weapon poison doesn't reduce lifesteal. Both work against STR Attribute Shift, though.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing, such as from STR Attribute Shift.\nSilences, stuns, taunts, fears, and hexes are all good ways to prevent Morphling from starting to Attribute Shift. They also prevent him from being able to un-Morph himself if he's cosplaying another hero.\nYou can click on an enemy Morphling and see his current AGI/STR Attribute Shift ratio. The longer a fight goes, the likelier it is that he's had to shift more STR to survive. The tankier Morph is, the lower his damage is going to be from AGI.\nYou may be your own hero's worst nightmare. For example: You know what Ember Spirits love doing? Rooting people and dealing magic damage. You know what Ember Spirits hate? Being rooted from Searing Chains and not being able to deal magic damage through Flame Guard. Know how to deal with your own spells in case Morphling Morph's into you or your teammates.\nYou can see how much time Morphling has left in a Morph by clicking it and checking the buff timer.\nElder Titan can be annoying for Morphling to deal with. A big reason why Morphling can feel so tanky is because he gets so much armor from his AGI. ET basically bypasses all of that with Natural Order's main armor reduction.\nDrow Ranger has a lot of tools to deal with Morphling. Marksmanship ignores main armor (base armor + AGI armor), Gust silence can catch a Morphling off guard before he gets Attribute Shift off, and her Agh's Scepter \"Hypothermia\" on Frost Arrows reduces HP gain from Attribute Shift."

        "guide": "Tips\nCancel your Razes. The cast time is long, so if you know you're going to miss, hit the stop key.\nLanding multiple Razes adds stacking amounts of damage and slow on enemy targets and Roshan. Each Raze landed refreshes the debuff.\nLanding multiple Razes on a hero can sometimes be challenging when the game's pathing doesn't cooperate. A handy console command to work around this is:\n\n      cl_dota_alt_unit_movetodirection true\n\nThis command makes it so that whenever you're holding down ALT, your hero ignores pathing and tries to move in a straight line towards where you right clicked. You can also enable the \"Directional Move\" hotkey in the settings, but this ALT modifier may be easier to use once you get used to it.\nYou can try to mask some of the Shadow Raze cast animation while turning. If you're facing one direction, click where you want to angle the Raze and immediately hit the spell hotkey. Your hero will already begin the Raze cast animation while you're spinning giving the enemy less time to react. For a full 180\u00b0, nearly half the cast animation will be complete by the time you finish turning.\nIf you're having a hard time in lane, go head to the nearest jungle camp and Raze it down for quick souls.\nShadow Fiend is one of the most useful heroes to learn Tread switching on since he can make use of all three attributes and frequently gets a Bottle.\nWard type units, like Clockwerk's Cogs or Venomancer's Plague Wards, have souls for some reason for Necromastery.\nThe \"Shadowraze Applies Attack Damage\" talent basically adds an instant attack on top of each Raze. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers. If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on each target hit in the Shadowraze AoE.\nSince an instant attack is being applied, Shadowraze will break your Smoke if it damages a unit with this talent.\nThe \"Shadowraze Applies Attack Damage\" talent also works with your Agh's Shard Necromastery. One target in the Shadowraze AoE will randomly receive the Necromastery fear attack and put the shard on cooldown.\nPresence of the Dark Lord does not affect enemies who don't have vision of you. Therefore, you can click on enemies and look if they have the Presence debuff to check if they can see you or not.\nYou can use a 'stop' command to cancel your Requiem of Souls cast animation without putting it on cooldown.\nThe entire Requiem of Souls cast animation remains hidden under an invis rune or Shadow Blade invisibility. This is because beginning a cast animation doesn't remove invisibility, invis only gets removed once a spell (or attack) is triggered.\nUnlike most other fears, Requiem fears enemies away from Shadow Fiend, rather than towards their fountain.\nTry to use the Requiem fear to set up easy triple Razes on a target who's running in a predictable fixed direction.\nAgh's Scepter upgraded Requiem will also fear enemies when the lines return.\nCounters\nDon't forget that he mini-Requiems when he die--too late, you ate it.\nRemember that SF loses some Necromastery souls on death. So if he just respawned or bought back, he's not going to be at full power.\nThe Requiem slow and fear debuff can be dispelled with basic dispels."

        "guide": "Tips\nDoppelganger allows you to travel up and down cliffs.\nDoppelganger breaks trees upon landing. Use this to find juking enemies or to create quicker jungle routes.\nMuch like every other illusion hero out there, you can sometimes be tricky by microing an illusion out of the pack to bait enemies into thinking it's the real you.\nThe brighter of the two illusions from Doppelganger is the one that takes 100% damage. You can assign this one to a control group and it will stick each time Doppelganger is used.\nDoppelganger can dispel all the debuffs that a Manta Style would... except for roots and silences because you literally can't cast the spell when rooted or silenced.\nCasting Doppelganger adds 2 seconds duration to any gathered illusions.\nTreat Doppelganger's banish like Puck's Phase Shift when playing against a team with a lot of projectile spells.\nIf you get jumped by an enemy and need to banish yourself quickly, cast Doppelganger in the same direction your hero is facing rather than turning around. PL's turn rate is average, but every millisecond can count when escaping.\nDoppelganger forces your hero's location to the target area once the banish ends. This allows you to outplay spells like Disruptor's Glimpse or Kunkka's X Marks the Spot which typically take repositioning priority.\nWhen Roshing, you can click on Rosh to see the cooldown on his Slam. Rosh will always cast it once his attack animation ends and it's off cooldown. Doppelganger during the cast animation to avoid you and your illusions taking a bunch of unnecessary damage.\nYou can get cute with denies by Phantom Rushing to an enemy creep, canceling the Rush, then hitting your creep while the AGI buff is on.\nPhantom Rush can be toggled on or off. This is useful in the laning phase if you only want it to trigger when last hitting specific creeps.\nIf you see a unit across a cliff, but you're in Phantom Rush range, PL will sprint to it taking the quickest pathing possible.\nWhen farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Phantom Rush onto to quickly go up cliffs or behind trees without using Doppelganger.\nPhantom Rush is always toggled on for Juxtapose illusions and will always be off cooldown when they spawn.\nDon't forget to utilize Phantom Rush when escaping. Sprint to a neutral or enemy lane creep to get the speed boost. Phantom Rush will even work on enemy buildings and ward units.\nPhantom Rush speed overrides any slowing debuffs that your hero or illusions are under.\nWhen tower diving, A+left click (or your attack/deny command hotkey) your illusions during attack backswings to attempt to shake tower aggro momentarily.\nUse A+left click (default) when taking jungle camps or Rosh to relieve yourself of creep aggro once you generate some illusions.\nYou can use the \"next unit\" hotkey in your settings to rapid fire cycle through your illusions and send them in a bunch of different directions to cause chaos when you're escaping an enemy.\nJuxtapose doesn't multiply on buildings, but does on wards. This makes PL very effective against things like Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards, Pugna's Nether Ward, Undying's Tombstone, Venomancer's Plague Wards, and Zeus's Nimbus. Illusions don't deal damage to Phoenix's Supernova, but you can Juxtapose off hitting it.\nCounters\nTry to bait out Doppelganger by animation canceling spells.\nIf you think you've finally found the real PL and started targeting a spell on him, resist the urge to keep mashing the hotkey. You may inadvertently cancel the cast and lose him again in the Sea of Lancers.\nSome debuffs that can help identify the real PL that can't be dispelled by Doppelganger: Bloodseeker's Rupture, Huskar's Burning Spears, Invoker's Deafening Blast, Shadow Demon's Shadow Poison, Ursa's Fury Swipes, Viper's Viper Strike, Windranger's Focus Fire, and Nullifier's active.\nMonkey King's Jingu Mastery counter can't be dispelled and the counter doesn't apply on illusions. So if you Boundless Strike his army, you'll immediately be able to find the real PL.\nOther heroes with spells that are particularly useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.\nAnother useful method to identifying the real PL is to quickly check his Magic Wand charges. PL illusions will duplicate the number of charges the real hero has when they're created, but won't get new charges unlike the real PL. This is mainly useful when he's escaping with Doppelganger and trying to juke you with his tanky illusion.\nRubick can't Spell Steal from illusions. You can mash Spell Steal on PL's army to vaguely identify the real one since all the fake illusions will give Spell Steal an error. The error works even when Spell Steal is out of range, so you can globally identify the real PL with this.\nWhile Morphling can't copy PL's Juxtapose as a Morph, Spirit Lance/Doppelganger illusions created by a Morphed PL can Juxtapose, allowing you to create your own PL army by proxy.\nPhantom Lancer can't cast Doppelganger while rooted/leashed.\nRadiance's Burn, Shiva's Guard's Arctic Blast, and Maelstrom, Mjollnir, and Gleipnir's Chain Lightning all deal bonus damage to illusions.\nMjollnir's Static Shield active has a chance to proc off of every PL illusion whacking you.\nCrimson Guard's active basically neutralizes all illusion damage, though you'll still take the mana burn from Diffusal.\nDebuff immunity/BKB prevents mana burn from Diffusal Blade.\nPhantom Lancer, his illusions, and Diffusal Blade all deal physical damage, so build armor."

        "name": "Puck",
        "guide": "Tips\nIllusory Orb is your main escape before you get Blink Dagger. The second you toss out an Orb to damage some creeps, your faerie dragon ass starts looking much tastier to kill. This is most relevant when you're in the mid lane and you're trying to push the wave to get the rune. Only use the Orb if you're confident that you can't get nuked down while Orb is on cooldown.\nWhen pushing, cast Illusory Orb from the back of the enemy creep wave towards your creeps or into trees and then Jaunt to it. This can help create a buffer from heroes who will try to gank you once they see your Orb is down.\nEven when farming, try to put some brainpower into the angle you're casting your Orb. You never know when you may suddenly get vision of an enemy and have a chance to Jaunt in or out to escape or get a kill. Or cast it in the direction of the next neutral camp you want to farm.\nIllusory Orb's projectile gives flying vision. Not only does it give vision around the Orb itself, but the vision lingers for a few seconds along its path as well. Use it for scouting, shutting down juking, or finishing off couriers.\nDamage from projectiles is calculated on impact with an enemy. If you're trying to squeeze every last bit of mana out from a lane, you can cast Illusory Orb and then level it up while it's flying. This allows you to cast it with the cheaper mana cost, but have it deal damage from the higher level. Incredibly nerdy maneuver, but it does work.\nThere are three main ways to Jaunt the full distance reliably. Either you watch for the Orb to turn red, listen to the sound pitch of the Orb, or you can just count to 3.\nIf you're quick, you can toss an Orb, start channeling a TP, and shift+queue Jaunt to take an extremely quick trip to the fountain. Useful for filling up your bottle or picking up items from your stash and then immediately returning to the lane.\nWhen you're on the run, toss an Orb in one direction and continue walking in another direction. If the enemies chasing you commit to the Orb, don't Jaunt, if they keep following you, Jaunt.\nYour Illusory Orb remains active even after you die. In very specific situations you can consider buying back and immediately Jaunting after you die to return to a fight.\nYou can double tap Waning Rift to cast it in place.\nWaning Rift does not disjoint projectiles.\nYou only need to cast Phase Shift to disjoint things, you don't need to complete the channel. If a tower shot is about to hit you, just tap Phase Shift and keep moving.\nYou can avoid Bloodseeker's Rupture damage even if you Jaunt within the 1300 distance limit, but the steps are precise. If you're Ruptured, toss out an Orb and then wait in Phase Shift, then Jaunt. If you only mash Phase Shift and then instantly Jaunt, you will take damage. But if you spend at least half a second in Phase Shift before Jaunting you'll avoid the damage.\nWith Agh's Shard, Phase Shift attack will hit every valid unit and building, but won't attack ward-type units.\nWith Agh's Shard, you can go into Silver Edge, activate Phase Shift during the fade time, and get the Break and backstab on all targets in the AoE. You'll also get reported for building Silver Edge on Puck.\nIf you click in a direction to turn before casting Phase Shift, you'll complete your rotation while in Phase Shift. This is similar to the turning before RP'ing trick on Magnus.\nPuck can completely avoid spells like Ice Path and even insta-cast spells like hexes while Phase Shifted as long as you Blink in the direction you were facing before you Phase Shifted. If you try to Blink in a different direction, you'll get caught due to turn rate after Phase Shift ends.\nKeep your eyes peeled on enemy neutral items. A random silence from the \"Mind Breaker\" neutral item can ruin your day if you aren't ready for it.\nDream Coil leashes enemies, which stops them from using most movement spells and also prevents them from TP'ing.\nDream Coil will leash invisible, fogged, and even untargetable heroes like a Slark in Shadow Dance or Dark Willow in Shadow Realm.\nIt will not catch invulnerable units, like enemies under Naga's Song of the Siren sleep or in a Eul's cyclone. Nor hidden units, like enemies in a banish.\nNothing can stop your Agh's Scepter Dream Coil attacks as long as you're in range of your targets and as long as the Dream Coil debuff is applied to them. You will continue dealing attacks while banished (like Phase Shift or Eul's cyclone) or disarmed.\nYou'll even attack debuff immune/BKB'd enemies. Again, as long as the Dream Coil debuff is on an enemy, you'll attack them.\nCounters\nAs soon as the Orb comes out, start looking for the kill. Puck may be hard to lock down, but Orb being on cooldown halves this hero's survivability in the early game.\nIllusory Orb travels for ~3 seconds. Most stuns last ~2 seconds. Save your stun for around 1 second after an enemy Puck tosses out an Orb. If they Jaunt within that second, they didn't get very far anyway so whatever.\nPlaying against Puck in lane is all about baiting out useless Phase Shifts. Animation canceling is usually the easiest way, but smart Pucks ain't about that cancel lyfe and won't get scared by your Magnus practicing lacrosse with Shockwave canceling. So just wait for them to use Phase Shift for some other reason (tower shots, creep aggro) or try to bait it by tossing out a less important spell (Queen of Pain's Shadow Strike is the textbook example) or an auto-attack.\nPuck can't Jaunt to an Illusory Orb or move with Waning Rift when rooted/leashed, however Phase Shifting is still possible.\nYou can watch the debuff timer of Dream Coil ticking down to know when it's safe to start walking out of it. People are always very impressed when you walk out of a Dream Coil right as it's ending, like accelerating your car during a red light when you know it's about to turn green.\nYou can Wind Waker yourself out of a Dream Coil by moving the cyclone.\nTechnically, you can also Eul's out of Dream Coil but it's very hard to do. Since Eul's rotates your hero slightly, if you go to the very very edge of the Coil leash and activate Eul's, your hero may snap the Coil mid-air. You can vaguely eyeball the distance needed by hovering over your Eul's cast range circle since it's nearly the same as the Coil break range.\nIf you have quick fingers, you can Force Staff yourself and activate Manta Style as you're sliding right before you break the Coil. The Manta Style banishment will absorb the Coil stun. Or you can just yolo for a lucky Manta rearrangement at the edge of a Coil if you're feelin' cocky."

        "name": "Pudge",
        "guide": "Tips\nPart of being a good Pudge is more than landing Hooks, but also knowing when your Hooks won't land. The cast time is long enough that you should be able to at least occasionally stop-cancel unlikely Hooks. Stop-canceling Hooks is also a great way to stress out enemies who can see you.\nArguably the most reliable way of predicting enemy movement for Hooks during the laning phase is to watch for last hits. While you're hiding, watch the HP of your creeps and wait for the enemy to pick up the last hit. The knowledge of where they will be plus their attack animation should be enough to land a Hook fairly easily. If the only thing between you and the enemy is a creep, start casting the Hook right before they complete the last hit so the Hook passes through the creep as it's dying.\nYou can pull runes using Meat Hook and the mana cost on Hook will be refunded. You can abuse this with Soul Ring to refund the 'temporary' mana provided by the Ring's active.\nMeat Hook will always bring the unit it caught to your cast location when the Hook finishes returning. With expert timing, you can use this mechanic to save allies who are being repositioned with spells (like Disruptor's Glimpse or Kunkka's X Marks the Spot) or catch escaping enemies (like an Io Relocate) by having them be mid-return-Hook when the repositioning spell is triggered.\nThis also works with TPing allies to bring them back after they spend a split second in the fountain.\nMeat Hook can pull allies or enemies out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field, Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, and Mars's Arena.\nMeat Hook cannot pull allies or enemies that are being pulled by a Batrider's Flaming Lasso. However, if the Lasso ends mid-Hook, the target will end up next to Pudge once the Hook finishes returning.\nThere are certain spots in the mid lane and elsewhere around the map that you can jam your hero into that'll allow you to body block a Hook victim and prevent them from walking anywhere. Toss the Hook, then walk a tiny bit backwards to create a gap that only the victim can fit into.\nMeat Hook does not cancel channels on allies. You can Hook them while they're TPing and it won't interrupt it. Hell, you can even Hook and move an allied Witch Doctor channeling Death Ward and it won't interrupt him.\nMeat Hook damages, drags, and fully disables debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nMeat Hook instantly kills any enemy/neutral non-ancient creep in connects with. This includes enemy siege creeps.\nMeat Hook instantly kills enemy illusions.\nUse Rot to help get last hits in lane.\nYou can't kill yourself with Rot damage.\nYou can toggle Rot while channeling and it won't cancel the channel. Like during Dismember or a TP.\nFlesh Heap can be activated while channeling. Like during Dismember or a TP.\nWalking up to a hero and Dismembering them without Hooking them is like getting body shots as a Sniper in TF2. No one will respect you, but who cares when you get the kill.\nTarget and cast Dismember while an enemy is getting Hooked to give them as little time as possible to react with a BKB or some gap creating spell. This works because the sooner you start your Dismember cast animation, the less time an enemy has to react. If you start walking towards the enemy while they're returning from Hook, they'll be in Dismember cast range sooner.\nWhen Roshing, don't use Dismember unless you're absolutely safe. It's a huge red flag for the enemy team that Pudge is off enjoying some fresh meat (the Dismember sound is global every time you cast it) despite the fact there is no hero on the map getting Benihana'd.\nDon't ever shift-queue Meat Hook after Dismember. You are almost always better off canceling the last few milliseconds of Dismember by casting Meat Hook rather than waiting for the channel and cast backswing to end.\nDismember lasts longer on creeps than heroes meaning you heal much more when you cast it on a creep. Useful if you need HP and don't care about the Dismember cooldown/mana cost.\nThis makes siege creeps great Dismember targets if you're trying to heal since most other creeps will die before Dismember's full channel duration completes.\nDismember provides true sight on the target.\nNever let Rubick steal Meat Hook. Constantly be spamming Rot against a Rubick.\nCasting Agh's Shard Dismember on an ally counts as a strong dispel.\nCounters\nPlay the hero and read the tips. The best way to beat a Pudge is to become the Pudge. You put Pudge into a cup, he becomes the cup, you put Pudge into a teapot, he becomes the teapot. Be Pudge, my friend.\nCheck Pudge's boots. If he's running at you with Rot and has Tranquils, you should right click him once to break his boots to slow his move speed before fleeing.\nLotus Orb prevents Pudge from casting Dismember on a target without it getting canceled instantly.\nDismember is a channeled disable, so stunning or silencing Pudge during the channel will end the spell."

Banishes or cyclones won't stop a Link in progress.\nMechanically, think of Static Link attacks as being similar to a short Windranger Focus Fire.\nStatic Link attacks scale with your attack speed.\nRazor doesn't attack during Static Link if he's disarmed.\nWhen moving in Static Link, you will face the direction you're clicking in, but once you stop clicking, Razor will turn around to face the enemy he's attacking. This is relevant when Static Linking a Medusa Stone Gazing so you can attack her and not get Stoned.\nIf for some reason you want to stop attacking a Static Linked target, like if they have Blade Mail active or something, you can hold down the \"Directional Move\" command and mash your right click movement. You have to mash your move commands because each new directional move input cancels the Static Link attack animation.\nYou can toggle the alt-cast of Agh's Shard Static Link while Link is active to control if you want the pull or not.\nThe pull on Agh's Shard Static Link is so strong that you can even pull enemies that are banished or out of a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Disruptor Kinetic Field.\nIf you're worried more about dealing damage than stealing damage it's okay to Link the Crystal Maiden to buff up your damage if Luna keeps breaking the Link. You can sap more damage than a hero actually has, so CM will see a fat red -168 by her measly 63 damage.\nIf you Static Link multiple enemies at the same time, you can only get moving attacks on one of the targets, not both targets simultaneously.\nRefreshing Static Link allows another Link to add another buff to Razor, but you can't double Link one target at the same time.\nRefreshing Eye of the Storm fully stacks the spell.\nEye of the Storm prioritizes striking Static Linked heroes.\nEye of the Storm does not work on Roshan.\nEye of the Storm does, however, work on Tormentors.\nEye of the Storm does not hit units in fog.\nCounters\nJust because Razor died doesn't mean you get all your damage back instantly, and just because you died doesn't mean Razor won't keep dealing +200 damage. Static Link's buff/debuff will remain for the full duration.\nForce Staff can help allies break the Static Link.\nRazor won't right click during Static Link if he's disarmed.\nLotus Orb can discourage Razor from Static Linking allies. If a melee hero reflects a Static Link, the spell's internal attacks will only work if Razor is within 350 + melee hero attack range (default 150). Any further and the Static Link attacks will miss.\nEye of the Storm does not hit units in fog. No point trying to juke if you're Static Linked, however, because Static Link provides vision on the target."

        "guide": "Tips\nThe only reason you shouldn't hero target Burrowstrike is if you're going for multi-hero stuns or if you're trying to achieve a very specific position. Unlike Lion's Earth Spike, the bonus range granted by skillshotting Burrowstrike is barely anything (~100 units extra).\nLinken's Sphere will always block Burrowstrike regardless of how you targeted it.\nCasting Burrowstrike on a Lotus Orbed target will have you swap positions with the enemy while stunning them on the way.\nSand King isn't actually 'traveling' during Burrowstrike. It's more like you turn into a projectile and show up at your destination. As a result, you'll completely bypass any spells that may be in your path (like Dark Willow's Bramble Maze, Jakiro's Ice Path, or even a Faceless Void's Chronosphere).\nThe combination of him having no cast times, Burrowstrike being a stunning Force Staff that doesn't break trees, quick fade time on Sand Storm invis, and the fact that Blink Dagger is a core item makes Sand King's jukeability extremely potent. Use all of this to your advantage and be unpredictable. Cast Sand Storm, but then immediately change directions while you're invisible. Use Sand Storm to disjoint attacks until your Blink Dagger comes off cooldown. Burrowstrike into the trees and start TPing. The only limit is yourself. And your mana.\nAttacking or casting an item/spell while in the Sand Storm AoE will temporarily reveal you for a brief period of time, but you'll go back invis after.\nSand Storm will very slowly move to center itself on your hero as you walk around in the AoE.\nYou can remove Dust detection (after you walk out of the AoE) with basic dispels, like from Eul's, Guardian Greaves, or Lotus Orb.\nYou can use a 'stop' command to cancel your Epicenter cast animation without putting it on cooldown.\nIf you're planning on casting Epicenter post-Burrowstrike, aim the Burrowstrike so you end up behind the enemy. This'll buy you a turn animation's amount of time before they can spin around and attempt to interrupt your Epicenter cast.\nIf you're going to shift-queue your Blink Dagger after the Epicenter animation, choose your destination at the very last second. Things can change during the long ass cast animation. Positions can move, TPs come in, Blinks go out, empires fall.\nIf enemies have vision of any part of the Agh's Shard Epicenter AoE, the whole spell is shown through fog.\nAgh's Shard Epicenter pulses trigger on invisible and fogged units.\nCounters\nA value Dust or sentry ward in lane can go a long way against a Sand King who's always sitting around in their Sand Storm.\nDust is especially irritating for Sand King to deal with since he'll need to leave the reveal AoE which basically defeats the purpose of Sand Storm.\nSand King cannot Burrowstrike when rooted.\nCaustic Finale won't trigger if a unit is denied.\nIf you don't have a stun/silence to interrupt Sand King's Epicenter animation, you can still potentially disable his Blink Dagger with damage. Making him waste 2-4 Epi pulses for a 0.1s Windranger Powershot or some other long range spell is a great trade."

        "guide": "Tips\nStatic Remnants give you flying vision around their cast point. Use this to find people trying to juke in the trees, scout Rosh, or check cliffs for wards.\nStatic Remnants last quite a while, so it's not a bad idea to set some up if you're afraid a Riki or Smoked hero is trailing you since they'll detonate and damage on invis units.\nYou can drop a Static Remnant on an Aegis reincarnation to prevent the enemy from Blinking out since the Remnant will detonate as soon as the enemy respawns.\nYou can Overload an auto attack while the projectile is flying in the air. If you just tossed a long range auto attack on a target, you can cast a Remnant or Ball real quick and the attack will hit Overloaded.\nGet your free Overloads. Cast a spell in the fountain or throw up a quick Remnant once you reach your destination if you're going to be TPing to a tower. Or use a spell before activating an invis rune.\nYou can cast spells like Static Remnant or Electric Vortex while flying in Ball Lightning.\nYou can use items while in Ball Lightning, like Scythe of Vyse or Orchid.\nYou can begin channeling a TP while flying in Ball Lightning. Useful when escaping or during base defenses to kill a creep wave while zipping and TPing back to safety at the same time.\nYou can pick up items while flying in Ball Lightning. Like an Aegis, perhaps.\nYou can pick up runes that are along your path while in Ball Lightning. You can activate runes and use Bottle while in Ball.\nYou can start a drive-by Outpost, Lotus Pool, or Watcher channel by clicking them during Ball Lightning.\nJust be aware that you can only channel a single Lotus at a time. You can't grab the entire Pool in one drive-by.\nWhile traveling in Ball Lightning, Storm will attempt to perform the next action you ordered once he gets in range to do it. If there is no action (like a right click on the enemy hero), he'll just auto attack the nearest thing if Auto Attack is set to 'Standard.'\nThis can be irritating when you're Balling long distances or into fogged vision because Storm may waste the Overload attack on a creep that's in attack range while mid-Ball. To avoid this, hit the stop key while you're flying and he won't attack anything while flying and he'll do nothing when he lands.\nIf you lose your Overload attack while flying in Ball Lightning, you can just re-cast Ball Lightning mid-flight and you'll get another Overload charge for free.\nIf you need escape quickly when an enemy is setting up on you, be cognizant of your turn rate. You may be better off doing a quick zip forward rather than risking turning around in front of the enemy.\nAvoid making multiple short trips when you're escaping and Balling on a mana budget. Do one long trip. There's no reason to have to pay the ignition cost of Ball Lightning multiple times if you have one destination.\nBall Lightning disjoints projectiles on cast.\nYou can cast a 0 range Ball Lightning by clicking your hero portrait when targeting Ball.\nIf you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" option enabled, you can also double tap Ball Lightning to cast it in place to get an Overload or for the disjoint.\nIf you Ball Lightning over the edges of the map, you briefly get high ground vision over the surrounding treeline.\nIf you Ball Lightning over the edges of the map at an angle, you'll be placed back onto the map without breaking any trees behind you. If you're trying to escape enemies chasing you in the trees, consider doing this instead of zipping down every tree in a straight line.\nYou are considered 'invulnerable' while in Ball Lightning (similar to being in a Eul's cyclone), so brush up on your jukenomics. Besides using the invulnerability to absorb projectiles, spells like Bloodseeker's Rupture won't affect you when you're traveling and you can even fly through a Faceless Void's Chronosphere without getting locked.\nSince you are invulnerable while in Ball Lightning, you can cast items like Orchid on a target with Lotus Orb and not worry about it getting reflected back. You can also avoid a reflected Electric Vortex, but you have to target Ball Lightning far enough away that the 0.3s cast animation of Vortex takes place while you're still in Ball Lightning.\nYou are not considered 'hidden/banished' in Ball Lightning. That means certain spells that affect invulnerable units, like Dark Seer's Vacuum, Silencer's Global Silence, or Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap can still affect you while you're in Ball Lightning.\nIf you need to chain multiple Ball Lightning casts as quickly as possible, you need to try and time your next Ball Lightning when you're slightly less than 0.3s away from the first Ball Lightning ending. This way most of the cast animation for the next zip happens as the previous zip is ending. If you do it too early, Storm Spirit won't do anything when the first Ball Lightning ends. If you do it too late, you'll be vulnerable for a brief moment during the new zip's cast animation. This is mainly relevant during high ground defenses where you need to shoot out of your base to kill the creep wave and return back as safely as possible.\nDoing multiple quick Ball Lightnings is a great way to torture heroes who have long cast animations. They'll have to keep turning and resetting their cast animation every time you Ball around them.\nArcane Rune reduce all aspects of Ball Lightning's mana costs (both the initial jump and travel cost).\nRemember that the Regen Rune ends once your hero is at max HP/mana. Keep zipping around and farming with Ball Lightning to keep yourself below max mana to take advantage of the full rune duration.\nCounters\nShut his mouth. Silences and most other disables irritate Storm. The more time he has to spend walking around with non-Overloaded right clicks, the less happy he is.\nBreak his ankles. Like most other heroes with a Blink, Storms will overshoot Ball Lightning down the path that they think you're traveling so they can get in more right clicks. If you're escaping out of his auto attack range during a gank, as soon as he starts Balling towards you, turn around and move to where he just was. He'll either have to Ball again or slowly walk to come back.\nTie him up. Storm can't cast Ball Lightning when rooted. Heroes with roots/leashes are obviously great, but don't forget about Rod of Atos.\nGhost Scepter is an underrated item against Storm. Yes, most of his damage is magic, but he actually has to right click on you to deal it.\nMana burn can be annoying for Storm to deal with. Anti-Mage, for example, loves going up against Storm Spirits.\nNyx Assassin can be annoying for Storm to deal with since he may inadvertently trigger Spiked Carapace with Overload or Static Remnant's AoEs.\nDark Seer's Vacuum and Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap affect invulnerable targets. So you can potentially take Storm out of Ball Lightning with these spells.\nDisruptor's Agh's Scepter Static Storm can mute invulnerable targets. If a Storm Spirit keeps killing your creep wave with repeated Ball Lightning+TP combos when you're trying to siege his high ground, you can risk catching him by surprise by canceling his TP with an early Static Storm in his Ball Lightning path.\nIf you're Roshing and you suspect Storm may attempt to snatch the Aegis, try dropping some useless items like your Quelling Blade or Wraith Bands around Rosh. While he's frantically trying to pick up an Aegis, he may end up jamming his inventory with your decoy items.\nBefore Storm hits level 6, he's pretty vulnerable to ganks with his slow move speed and no escapes. Consider rotating to gank him early on in the game to slow him down.\nThe Overload buff can be dispelled off Storm Spirit.\nAgh's Shard Overload can be dispelled off enemies."

If an enemy has Linken's but is sitting inside their creep wave, just target the Hammer on a creep.\nWarcry works fully on illusions and creep-heroes (Visage Familiars, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, or Warlock's Golem).\nGod's Strength multiplies Sven's primary attribute/base damage. Meaning, when you go full WOLOLO, only damage from STR is getting multiplied, but items that are adding green + damage (raw damage items) aren't get multiplied.\nAgh's Scepter Storm Hammer can dispel things like Ghost Scepter or spells like Omniknight's Guardian Angel.

You can even travel in and out of Mars's Arena thanks to the invulnerability as well.\nCounters\nStorm Hammer's projectile can be disjointed.\nWarcry can be removed off Sven and his allies with basic dispels.\nCleave damage, like from Great Cleave, is reduced by armor values.\nThe \"Gossamer Cape\" neutral item can be a valuable pickup against Sven for the evasion."

        "guide": "Tips\nAvalanche is constantly stunning in the AoE. So throw it in advance if you know a hero will be in the AoE before it finishes (mid-banish, pre-TP).\nAvalanche deals bonus damage to enemies that are Tossed.\nThe Ava-toss combo works best if you use Toss slightly after Avalanche connects.\nWhile it can be tempting to always combo Avalanche into Toss, remember that Toss itself counts as a brief stun. Against enemies with escapes you may be better off staggering the Toss after Avalanche's stun ends to squeeze in more right clicks or to buy more time for allies to arrive.\nToss damages buildings if a unit lands near it.\nYou can Toss people to runes.\nTossing enemy or allied heroes will break their channels.\nToss always grabs the unit closest to Tiny.\nToss ignores enemy Linken's Spheres.\nIf you target Toss's landing on to an enemy that has Lotus Orb, they will Toss whatever you threw at them right back to you. If you Toss an enemy that has Lotus Orb straight up in the air, you should walk away because Lotus Orb will attempt to find a nearby unit to throw at you once they land. If you're the nearest unit, you'll get Tossed straight up in the air.\nWhile you do need vision of a Toss target, you don't need vision of the unit you're going to Toss. Say an enemy is juking in fog, you can just mash Toss on a nearby target and Tiny will immediately grab the nearest valid unit, even if they're in fog, and Toss them. Useful against something like a Tree Dancing Monkey King who you can't see.\nYou can't Toss invisible units, though. So to clarify: You can Toss units that aren't visible, but you can't Toss units that are invisible. Got it? Good.\nWhen you're getting ganked by melee enemies, always be looking for units to Toss your aggressors away to.\nNext level plays when playing against melee-range Blink initiators: Bait yourself by hanging around in enemy vision and start mashing Toss on a target nearby. The moment you get Blinked on, you'll immediately Toss the enemy before they can react. Toss has an instant cast animation so you should theoretically be able to beat any kind of Blink initiation besides hex. This could be useful against heroes like Batrider or Magnus who have to get within Toss range to initiate on you.\nIf allies are caught on the edge of a Faceless Void Chronosphere, you can Toss them out.\nYou can Toss targets in or out of a Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nWith BKB, you can potentially go into a Static Storm+Kinetic Field and Toss allies out to save them.\nAttacking a building with a Tree can splash/cleave damage onto creeps, but attacking creeps will not splash damage onto buildings.\nWhen ground targeting a Tree Throw, the tree will disintegrate and damage the first enemy unit it collides into, ignoring structures. A Thrown Tree will not 'cleave,' but instead explode in a circular AoE around the target.\nThrowing a Tree provides vision as it travels.\nTree Throw's damage is applied as an instant attack on the target hit. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers. If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on the primary target.\nSince Tree Throw is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.\nYou can activate Shadow Blade/Silver Edge after the Tree is thrown to get the backstab damage on the target hit.\nThe splash damage from a Thrown Tree is not classed as an instant attack. So you can't apply Desolator on everyone hit by a Thrown Tree, for example, only the primary target.\nYou can't directly target couriers with Tree Throw, but a skillshotted Tree or a Throw that explodes near a courier can kill the donkey.\nDenial attacks with a Tree will consume charges but won't cleave onto enemies.\nLet your right clicks finish. Tiny's attack speed is constantly changing throughout the course of the game, which makes it a real pain to consistently cancel his backswing animation. Err on the side of caution and be patient.\nYou can \"store\" the max attack speed second hit of an Echo Sabre by cancelling the attack before it connects. The attack speed buff lasts indefinitely, so you can spend the first right click on a creep and then store the fast attack for another target.\nEcho Sabre will apply the slow with every Agh's Scepter Tree Volley attack and not go on cooldown.\nThe slow resistance mechanic, from spells like Grow, only reduces move speed slows, not attack speed slows.\nCounters\nAs long as the rocks are flying around, an Avalanche will stun you if you walk into the AoE.\nAvalanche completely ignores any sources of status resistance.\nBeware of being Tossed backwards into Tiny's tower during the laning phase. If Tiny starts running towards you for no good reason, watch out.\nBreaks don't disable any aspect of Tiny's Grow. Would be pretty funny if it did, though.\nTiny is all about burst comboing enemies down. Consider investing in HP items (Blood Grenade, Fluffy Hat, Bracer) if you're a squishy support that keeps getting one-shotted."

You can potentially cast the Magic Missile on a nearby creep if a hero is far away and bank on the bounce landing on your target.\nAgh's Shard Magic Missile can bounce to invisible targets, fogged targets, smoked targets, and even a Slark in Shadow Dance or a Dark Willow in Shadow Realm.\nA bounced Agh's Shard Magic Missile will still be blocked by Linken's Sphere, but won't reflect from Lotus Orb.\nWave of Terror is a useful spell for scouting out dangerous territory because of its massive range and lingering vision. Also useful for dewarding cliffs.\nWave of Terror damage can cancel consumable regen like Salves or Clarities from long range. It's also useful at breaking Blink Daggers from long range.\nWave of Terror works on Roshan and Tormentors.\nVladmir's Offering can be a worthwhile pickup on VS because between Vengeance+Vladmir's Aura you're a huge bonus damage providing hero.\nVengeance Aura boosts damage on player controlled units.\nWhen you die with Agh's Scepter, your Vengeance illusion spawns with its spell cooldowns immediately available.\nYour Agh's Scepter Vengeance illusion may be a 'strong' illusion, but it's still an illusion. This means it deals reduced damage versus buildings and Roshan, it can't copy a lot of attack modifiers, it doesn't benefit from + raw armor items, and it doesn't benefit from + raw damage items, and can't activate items. You don't even get the benefit of Vengeance Aura damage because Vengeance Aura provides + green damage.\nBecause the Agh's Scepter Vengeance illusion can cast spells, it can also channel Watchers and Outposts.\nIt can channel Lotus Pools as well, but the Lotuses don't transfer to your inventory when you respawn. They just disappear into the void.\nYou'll take your Agh's Scepter Vengeance illusion's place on the map when you respawn even when using buyback.\nNether Swap disables and swaps enemies through debuff immunity/BKB and invulnerability.\nBeing able to Nether Swap invulnerable units means you can Swap heroes that are cycloned or things like Storm Spirit inside Ball Lightning or units affected by Naga Siren's Song of the Siren.\nIf you're ever against an Enigma, your assignment is to sit around and play with your hair until you can use Swap to break Black Hole.\nIf things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Nether Swap by clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar. You can't target spells on enemies using top bar portraits, however.\nGlimmer Cape can be a handy pickup on VS since you can invisibly get into position, Swap a hero, and then fade out again.\nAether Lens can be a sneaky way to boost Nether Swap's range.\nCounters\nWave of Terror decreases armor dramatically. This means that it's very easy for VS's team to take Rosh early and it means that tower diving a VS can be very dangerous.\nDuring tier 3 tower defenses, make sure that the enemy team doesn't have wards on your high ground, otherwise someone is almost certainly going to get Swapped to the low ground.\nVengeance Aura is granted by illusions of VS. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take advantage of this.\nVengeance Aura can be disabled by Breaks.\nHer Agh's Scepter death illusion still spawns even if she's under a break debuff on death, however.\nVenge's Agh's Scepter death illusion is considered a 'strong' illusion and cannot be instagibbed by things like Lion's Mana Drain, hexes, or Dagon.\nBrewmaster's Primal Split Storm Brewling can deal a lot of damage to illusions, even 'strong' illusions, with the Dispel Magic spell.\nIllusions don't pop Smoke. So if you're running away from a Venge illusion, you can Smoke to lose her. You can also take advantage of this mechanic by offensively smoking to surround an unsuspecting Venge illusion who's farming right before her real hero respawns into it."

        "name": "Windranger",
        "guide": "Tips\nShackleshot calculates latch angles based on where it was originally cast, not from Windranger's current location.\nFor years man has wondered, \"How does Shackleshot work?\" Basically, it'll search for the closest available unit to the primary target to latch to. If there are no units in the AoE, it'll search for the closest available tree. It does not prioritize heroes over other unit types nor does it prioritize units in a straight line behind the main target.\nWhat sets good Windrangers apart from bad Windrangers is how frequently Shackles are cast on creeps. Bad Windrangers will almost always target it on a hero even if there's a far larger window to miss the latch.\nShackleshot can latch to units in fog and invisible units. If you know where an invisible target is (like a Templar Assassin in Meld), then you can try to position a creep in such a way that you can shackle the enemy hero as the secondary target.\nPowershot gives flying vision as the projectile travels and the vision lingers for a few seconds at the end point.\nBe aware that Powershot's massive range can also be a liability at times. If you're farming in dangerous areas, be careful with your Powershot angles, otherwise enemies may discover you're farming their jungle when they see a random green arrow fly by their heads.\nIf your hero is within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it if you damage the camp, like with Powershot. Any further away and neutrals won't aggro your hero when damaged and just keep sitting in their camp.\nWindrun gives you 100% evasion from incoming attacks, including attacks from towers.\nThe invisibility from Agh's Scepter Windrun cannot be removed by dispels.\nThe invisibility from Agh's Scepter Windrun is... kinda jank. Enemies won't be able to see your hero without true sight, but they will be able to see a selection circle underneath wherever your hero is while you're attacking from invisibility.\nYou can stop yourself from attacking a Focus Fired target by hitting the 'stop' or 'hold' hotkeys. If you right click on the target again, Focus Fire will resume. Useful to know against Blade Mail carriers.\nWhen moving in Focus Fire, you will face the direction you're clicking in, but once you stop clicking, Windranger will turn around to face the enemy she's attacking. This is relevant when Focus Firing a Medusa Stone Gazing so you can attack her and not get Stoned.\nFocus Fire doesn't give vision on the target. If someone is about to escape in fog, use a quick Powershot to keep vision on your target.\nYou cannot target ward type units (like Phoenix's Supernova, Pugna's Nether Ward, Undying's Tombstone) with Focus Fire.\nFocus Fire persists on enemies after they die with Aegis/Reincarnation. You'll immediately resume attacking the target at Focus Fire speed once they respawn. If Windranger has Aegis, however, you will lose the Focus Fire buff when you reincarnate.\nDespite its appearance, Agh's Shard Gale Force is not classified as traditional forced movement, but rather a \"pull.\" This means it can't interrupt things Magnus's Skewer, Phoenix's Icarus Dive, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge of Darkness, or a Techies Blast Off.\nCounters\nBe acutely aware of Windranger's angle to you and any allied creeps between you and her in lane. Windrangers are always fishing for Shackles, so keep mirroring her movements to make it difficult.\nConstantly keep her in your camera when laning against her. A full duration Powershot is not an easy spell for her to land, but it is if you're asleep at the wheel. Watch where she's aiming and move away.\nWindrun gives 100% evasion against physical attacks, but physical damage can still hurt her. This includes damage from spells like Dazzle's Shadow Wave or Death Prophet's Exorcism.\nGet an MKB or Bloodthorn to deal with Windrun evasion if you're a carry.\nWindrun can be removed with basic dispels like Oracle's Fortune's End or Enchantress's Enchant or Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge. Nullifier and Eul's can also dispel.\nHer \"Windrun Cannot Be Dispelled\" talent can counterplay this, however.\nWindranger will Focus Fire under any circumstances when she can normally right click her target. If she's stunned, slept, feared, ethereal, hexed, taunted, disarmed, or out of range, she won't attack.\nFocus Fire involves a bunch of smaller damage attacks in a quick period of time. This makes damage block items like Vanguard or Crimson Guard very effective at mitigating her damage.\nBlade Mail can make her think twice about wanting to Focus Fire you.\nIf a melee hero reflects Focus Fire with Lotus Orb, they'll need to be within 350 + melee hero attack range (default 150) to land attacks on Windranger. Any further and the attacks will miss."

        "guide": "Tips\nWhen playing Zeus, check to see if your lane enemy has a Magic Stick. If you're mid and they do, try to exclusively cast Arc Lightning from the high ground. Enemies only get Stick charges if the caster is in vision. If they get a charge even when you think you weren't in vision, that means they have a ward that can see you.\nArc Lightning won't bounce to targets that are in fog. Important to note in the mid lane if you're trying to get bounces to units that may be out of vision on high ground like a ranged creep.\nLightning Bolt gives vision, Arc Lightning does not. Cast Lightning Bolt first if you're chasing someone to make sure you don't lose your target in fog.\nIf you think someone is just about to escape vision, don't risk targeting Lightning Bolt directly on the hero, just cast it on the ground near them. Zeus will cancel his animation if it's directly targeted on a hero who goes into fog.\nGround targeting \"adds\" a bonus ~325 cast range to Lightning Bolt thanks to the search radius.\nIf you ground target Lightning Bolt from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nEarly game you don't really have the mana to burn to use Lightning Bolt's true sight for dewarding unless you're 100% sure you know where a ward is. Late game, though, you should be casting it all over the place to counterward.\nLightning Bolt has a ministun which allows you to cancel channels.\nHeavenly Jump allows you to pass over cliffs and can even get you out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field which most other movement spells get stopped by.\nTry to maintain mana for your Thundergod's Wrath in the early game. The potential of getting a kill on a hero from across the map will probably be more useful than the 2 last hits you picked up with Arc Lightning.\nIn late game situations, Thundergod's Wrath's biggest asset is the instant global vision it gives of the entire enemy team. Don't hesitate to cast it during downtime to verify enemy positions or check if they may have Smoked or use it as soon as a team fight starts to get every enemy's location.\nYou can use Thundergod's Wrath as temporary counter-initiation against teams with a lot of Blink Daggers.\nNimbus will Lightning Bolt and reveal invis units that walk into the field. It will also shock enemies under Smoke, but will not reveal them.\nEnemies need vision of the Nimbus unit to right click it, even after it Lightning Bolts them. Try to place it on cliffs or above trees whenever possible.\nThe Nimbus will always attack the unit closest to the center of the field.\nThe Nimbus works normally in a Faceless Void Chronosphere.\nCounters\nArc Lightning can only bounce to you if Zeus has vision of you.\nGet a Magic Stick if he's spamming Arc Lightning. Just remember that you only get stick charges on spells if the enemy is in vision.\nBuy a Smoke of Deceit against Zeus. Thundergod's Wrath only reveals invisible units, but does not damage them. But even then, Smoke is a weird type of invis, so even a Refreshed Thundergod's Wrath wouldn't kill you. Buy a Smoke. Use it when escaping with low HP. Laugh at Zeus in all chat.\nYour team should always prioritize building some sources of magic resistance against Zeus. Be it in the form of Cloaks, Glimmer Capes, BKBs, or Pipe.\nMelee heroes deal twice as much damage to the Nimbus compared to ranged heroes."

Cast it from the fog or high ground.\nYour hero can be facing in any direction when casting Torrent.\nTorrent provides a small radius of vision around its cast location.\nIf you get body blocked by enemies in trees, you can Torrent the enemy and walk underneath them.\nTorrent deals multiple ticks of damage over the course of the spell making it useful for burning off things like Templar Assassin's Refraction.\nTorrent deals damage and slow to all enemies in the AoE even if they didn't get hit by the stun.\nThe constant Torrent damage in the AoE can be useful at cancelling Blink Daggers on enemies that aren't targetable yet. Like someone TP'ing into a fight or respawning from an Aegis.\nIf you cast Torrent at around 57.5 seconds of any minute, you can use it to stack a jungle camp. This only works on certain camps, however. The reason is because Torrent raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights. You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the -spawnneutrals command with cheats enabled) to see which camps work and which ones don't.\nThe only aspect of Tidebringer that the primary target gets hit by is the bonus right click damage. The cleave damage does not affect the primary target. Since the cleave damage from Tidebringer is an amplified amount of your base attack damage, obviously you'd rather waste your 100% damage right click on an unimportant target so that your multiplied damage can cleave onto a more important target.\nYou can Tidebringer splash a Bane Nightmared unit and they won't wake up.\nThe splash particle effect from Tidebringer can indirectly show where an invisible unit is.\nYou can cast X Marks on yourself or an ally before getting teleported somewhere. Use this to quickly go back home, chug a few Bottle charges or pick up something from the shop, and then quickly come back on the lane.\nIf you cast X Marks Return on a hero who's getting Lassoed by Batrider, it'll instantly cancel the Lasso.\nYou can cast X Marks on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies and wait for their immunity to time out before Returning them.\nIf you're playing against enemies with short banishes (like Shadow Demon's Disruption, Puck's Phase Shift, Phantom Lancer's Doppelganger, anyone with Eul's, etc) stop-cancel your Torrent animation after X-ing to bait out usage of these banishes. Then just wait for the banish to end and continue the combo.\nThe stun from the Ghostship is nice, but defensively casting the boat to receive the Rum for the move speed and delayed damage buffs can be invaluable. There's no such thing as a fail boat.\nCounters\nIf Kunkka's sword is glowing that means Tidebringer is off cooldown.\nCleave damage, such as from Tidebringer, is reduced by damage block and armor.\nKunkka can't use Tidebringer if he's affected by Breaks like from Silver Edge or Viper's Viper Strike.\nActivating debuff immunity/BKB will prevent you from getting Returned from an X. Invulnerability, like from Cycloning yourself with Eul's or getting banished, can also dodge the Return, but you need to time it.\nIf you're playing against an extremely good Kunkka, they may fake the Torrent animation to bait you into Cycloning yourself preemptively. The best way to counter-counterplay this is to keep an eye on your Stick/Wand. If you get a charge, that means Kunkka cast his Torrent for reals.\nYou can also use the Eul's cyclone tactic on enemy X's. If Kunkka's being coy by X'ing himself or an ally and then going massively out of position before getting auto-Returned, try timing a Eul's so that they'll be mid-cyclone when the X buff times out.\nRubick has an interesting Spell Steal interaction with X Marks. If Rubick X Marks the same target as Kunkka, the first one to cast Return will prevent the other's Return from going off.\nFor example, Rubick could X an ally who's already been X'd by Kunkka, very quickly Return them to override Kunkka's X, and now Kunkka's Return won't work.\nTorrent doesn't deal enough damage to proc a Raindrop, so keeping one handy could save you from a lot of Ghostship damage.\nAgh's Shard Tidal Wave only disarms you. You can still cast spells and items while you're surfing."

        "guide": "Tips\nWhile Lina has a terrible auto-attack animation, she also has ludicrous range to compensate. Few heroes can trade hits with you, despite your pizza spinning auto attack.\nDragon Slave can use unit targeting or ground targeting. If an enemy is juking into fog, use ground targeting, otherwise Lina may cancel the unit-targeted cast if the enemy escapes vision.\nDragon Slave can hit targets almost 500 units farther than the max cast range of the spell, so stick to ground targeting if you're trying to damage an enemy that's escaping.\nIf you ground target Dragon Slave from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nLight Strike Array breaks trees in its AoE.\nKeep your eye on Fiery Soul stacks in your buffs. Burn a few spells on creeps or neutrals to maintain your stacks to stay in fight-ready condition.\nYou can scout for fogged or invisible enemies by casting spells in their direction and seeing if your Fiery Soul buff increases.\nYou can check Rosh status by casting spells in his pit since you'll get at least one Fiery Soul stack if he's alive.\nLaguna Blade SUPERCHARGES Lina.\nCounters\nThere is an extremely brief (0.25s) moment after Laguna Blade connects before the damage is actually dealt. You can dodge the damage with banishes, or invulnerability from spells like Morphling's Waveform or from items like Eul's Scepter or Manta Style activation if your timing is impeccable.\nLina gets a fairly large power spike at around 3-5 minutes once her nukes have a few levels. Coincidentally, this is the same time that Infused Raindrops become available for purchase. Her kill potential gets significantly cut by Raindrops, so consider buying them no matter what role you're playing."

        "guide": "Tips\nBe aware of the advantages of ground targeting Earth Spike. The cast range is about 300 units shorter than the actual range of the stun. Ground targeting also makes it possible to thread the needle between heroes, allowing you to potentially land the stun on multiple targets.\nThat being said, stop ground targeting Earth Spike when you don't have to. IceFrog's such a nice guy, he gives you a mostly guaranteed targeting system for free. There is a special circle in hell for Lions who skillshot and whiff Earth Spike on solo targets in targetable cast range.\nIf you ground target Earth Spike from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nEarth Spike will be blocked by Linken's Sphere on all targets hit by the projectile. Doesn't matter if you ground targeted the spell or not. This also means that any Lotus Orb'd hero will reflect Earth Spike if they get hit by it.\nYou can stack certain neutral camps with Earth Spike. This only works on some camps, however. The reason is because Earth Spike raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights. You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the -spawnneutrals command with cheats enabled) to see which camps work and which ones don't. The timing is extremely close, you have to click the spell at ~59s.\nIf you a feel a team fight coming on, keep casting and canceling Hex on their initiator. Hexes have 0 cast time and the moment your target comes into range (like with a Blink Dagger), the Hex will instantly get cast. If you're worried about Tidehunter Ravaging your team, group up all juicy-like, bait his Blink, then Frogitize him, Cap'n.\nEnemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Hex). If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nHex and Mana Drain are simple spells that instantly kill illusions. This doesn't work against 'strong' illusions, however, like from Chaos Knight's Phantasm.\nAgh's Shard Mana Drain on multiple targets makes you even more effective at clearing illusions.\nSecondary drains from Agh's Shard Mana Drain go further than Mana Drain's cast range. If you're trying to Drain an enemy out of range, try Draining yourself into an allied hero or ranged creep and you may catch the enemy with a secondary Drain.\nDespite Agh's Shard Mana Drain turning you debuff immune, it does not provide any kind of dispel on your hero.\nYou can cast Mana Drain on allies to give them mana and buff their move speed.\nYou can Mana Drain enemy ranged creeps and many jungle creeps to quickly get mana. Left click on a jungle creep to see if it has mana, some don't.\nTime your Mana Drains on enemy heroes in lane with last hits. If one of your creeps is about to die, start Draining. Either they go for the last hit and lose a bunch of mana or they immediately back off and lose the last hit.\nMana Drain is a cheap and long range way to break Linken's Sphere.\nMana Drain provides true sight on the target for its duration, but does not provide shared vision, so enemies can still break it by going into fog.\nYou get the Finger of Death bonus damage as long as the target dies within 3 seconds of getting Fingered. You don't have to kill steal everything at 100 HP to get the stack...\nCounters\nAlways be afraid of this guy. He can kill you with relative ease and makes disabling you seem such a breeze. If you see him suddenly start walking towards you, he's probably gearing up to Finger you or he's setting up for a gank.\nMana Drain breaks if you go into fog. If he's Draining you in lane, you may be able to stop the Drain quicker by going into tree fog rather than running out of the break distance.\nIf his Mana Drain doesn't break when you think it should, he likely has a ward providing vision of you.\nThere is an extremely brief (0.25s) moment after Finger of Death connects before the damage is actually dealt. You can dodge the damage with banishes or from something like Eul's or Manta Style if your timing is impeccable."

        "guide": "Tips\nEther Shock can hit secondary units almost twice as far away than the spell's cast range. If an enemy is making a run for it and is just out of cast range, try casting the Shock on the ranged creep right behind them to possibly hit them. Ether Shock won't bounce to units that are in fog, however.\nEther Shock chooses secondary targets in a cone in front of Shadow Shaman. Secondary targets are always the closest available units to the primary target.\nThe facts on Hex: Instant cast time, insta-kills illusions (but not 'strong' illusions), and is super annoying. Spam cast and cancel this spell on the enemy team's initiator when you're toeing off. The moment they Blink in and are in range, they'll be Rhasta Fried Chicken.\nEnemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Hex). If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nThe damage amplification from Hex works on Rosh. However, it doesn't work on Tormentors because, unlike magic amp and armor reduction, barriers ignore generic damage amp.\nAn enemy will always be able to activate BKB in-between Shackle and Hex. Lead with Hex during ganks, especially since Hex has no cast animation and also has longer range.\nShackles deals damage in a bunch of tiny instances, making it very effective to burn off things like Templar Assassin's Refraction.\nShackles provides true sight on the target.\nDon't let enemies farm your Serpent Wards for free if they win a team fight. It takes 2 attacks from a hero to kill a Ward. Select one lone Ward in the back and have it murder its siblings with a deny after one hero attack.\nThe Serpent Wards are controllable units. This hero is one of the few 'micro' heroes that box selection is encouraged on. Box your Serpents (or double click one, that'll select them all), tell them to stop spitting on creeps, and reorient them on the tower that you were trying to kill or on some hero that inadvertently bumbled back into the Snakes attack range.\nSerpent Wards can attack other types of ward units, like Pugna's Nether Ward or Undying's Tombstone.\nYou can trap enemies inside your Wards by targeting the circle directly onto a hero.\nSerpent Wards have 1200/800 day/night vision.\nTier 1 towers never have backdoor protection enabled, only Tier 2 onwards have it. Keep this in mind if you want to sneak a quick Tier 1 tower with Serpent Wards without a creep wave.\nSentry wards can tank ten hits from a tower before they die. If you're trying to sneakily take a tower and you really want to make sure it goes down, consider plopping down a sentry ward to draw the tower's aggro and then casting Serpent Wards. I guess you could also burn an observer ward for this strat, but you better have a huge lead if you're doing that.\nAfter you get an Agh's Shard, Shackle everything in sight to summon the free Serpent Wards to help you farm or push faster.\nCounters\nIf you're Ward trapped, you can Phase through the serpents using Phase Boots or certain invis abilities.\nDamage block does not mitigate Serpent Ward damage. All ward-type units ignore damage block.\nMass Serpent Ward costs a ton of mana, making Shaman a great candidate for mana burning or Pugna Nether Warding against.\nIllusion attacks count as hero attacks against Serpent Wards.\nYou can break these cuffs. Always have a stun/silence ready on your team to bail a teammate out from the Shackle channel.\nLotus Orb can help prevent Shadow Shaman from chain disabling allies."

The game won't allow you to have another bash besides Bash of the Deep.\nCorrosive Haze's armor reduction lets your team take Rosh or Tormentors much more easily.\nCorrosive Haze's true sight isn't some sort of get-out-of-buying-detection-free card.

Try to use it before Anchor Smash since Anchor Smash is physical damage.\nAnchor Smash is an extremely easy spell to animation cancel (hit the stop key). This is mainly relevant if you're laning against another melee hero since you can bait them out of getting last hits by throwing out fake Smashes.\nAnchor Smash's damage is applied as an instant attack. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers (except cleave). If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on each target hit.\nSince Anchor Smash is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.\nAnchor Smash works on ancient creeps, but not Roshan.\nThe \"Anchor Smash affects buildings\" talent also applies the damage reduction debuff to towers.\nAgh's Shard Dead in the Water provides true sight and exposes targets who move into fog.\nAgh's Shard Dead in the Water's fixed move speed even works on enemies who are hasted or have slow resistance.\nThe Agh's Scepter Gush projectile itself doesn't give any vision, but you will temporarily get vision on every unit hit. The projectile can also hit invisible enemies, but won't give true sight.\nCounters\nKraken Shell can be disabled with Breaks, like from Silver Edge or Viper's Viper Strike.\nKraken Shell can dispel a lot of debuffs, but certain persistent aura based debuffs like Disruptor's Static Storm or unit based debuffs like Grimstroke's Phantom's Embrace can be difficult for Tide to deal with.\nGet a Magic Stick in lane if Tide is gonna be spamming Anchor Smash.\nRavage has a travel time as it expands outward, so if you're quick, you can attempt Force Staffing or using some other repositioning spell/item to evade it.\nYou can even Blink inside of it since the Ravage AoE is a ring, not a filled circle."

In lane, try to pop an enemy with Cask after all their melee creeps die and only the lone ranged creep remains as a bounce target for maximum pinballing.\nYou can toggle Voodoo Restoration while channeling, such as during Death Ward or TPing. This is extremely important when playing against a Rubick to make sure he can't easily steal your Death Ward.\nIf you're trying to heal allies with Voodoo Restoration, just right click on them to follow them (assuming you don't have right click allies set to attack), rather than starting the impromptu Dota Hoedown that always occurs whenever people are fumbling to get into the heal AoE.\nMaledict can be a good way to keep an enemy Blink Dagger on cooldown since it lasts for so long.\nYou can choose your Death Ward's target. If you have the 'Unified Unit Orders' option checked, then you can just ctrl+right click who you want it to attack and you won't break your channel. Or, if you have your hero and the Death Ward selected and issue an attack command, it'll only send it to the Ward since you're channeling. Otherwise, just select it manually and right click your target.\nDid you know that you can get one extra Death Ward attack off if you spawn it west of your target? It's true! Is this important? Almost never!\nYou can get the Death Ward to stop attacking by issuing it a 'stop' command. Why would you, though?\nDeath Ward can attack creep-hero units like Brewmaster's Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.\nDeath Ward's cast range isn't too shabby. You want to try to exploit the full range every time you cast it so that enemies can't easily get to you to stop your channeling.\nDeath Ward requires vision of the target to hit them. Beware of casting the Death Ward on low ground or near a bunch of trees because your target may escape into fog.\nThe Death Ward provides vision around the unit itself (1200 day/800 night). The vision lingers for 5 seconds after the Death Ward disappears.\nAgh's Shard Voodoo Switcheroo's Death Ward behaves identically to a normal Death Ward. This means it benefits from Death Ward talents and the Agh's Scepter Death Ward bonuses.\nThis also means you can control the target of the Agh's Shard Voodoo Switcheroo Death Ward by right clicking on the enemy you want to attack.\nYou're stuck in the Agh's Shard Voodoo Switcheroo for the entire cast. You can't cancel it early, it's not a channel, it's more like a fixed duration banish.\nActivating Glimmer Cape/Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade will not cancel channels, so you can use these items in the middle of channeling Death Ward.\nActivating Ghost Scepter or BKB will cancel channels, so use these items before you start channeling Death Ward.\nAeon Disk being triggered on Witch Doctor does not stop Death Ward from dealing damage since wards are considered separate units. Same reason why an enemy with Blade Mail won't reflect any Death Ward damage onto Witch Doctor.\nWard units dealing their own damage also means that building spell amplification items on Witch Doctor will not increase Death Ward's damage.\nDeath Ward attacks have 50% accuracy against evasion.\nAgh's Scepter Death Ward attacks can bounce to creeps. This can be useful against zoo teams with a lot of summons/units.\nAgh's Scepter Death Ward attacks will not bounce to targets in fog.\nCounters\nDon't sit around next to your ranged creep once the rest of your creep wave dies. You're just asking for a Casking.\nMaledict deals extra damage depending on the amount of HP you've lost since the debuff was applied. If you heal yourself, you'll take less damage on the next curse tick.\nThe burst damage tick from Maledict triggers once every 4 seconds. Try timing whatever invincibility you may have (like from a banish) at those times.\nSomeone on your team needs to be dedicated to canceling WD's Death Ward.

If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nAgh's Shard Smoke Screen's makes enemies caught in the AoE untargetable by their teammates. For example, a Dazzle wouldn't be able to Shallow Grave a teammate caught in Agh's Shard Smoke Screen. Even debuff immune/BKB'd enemies who are in the Smoke Screen AoE can't be targeted by teammates.\nEnemies can still self-target spells/items on themselves if they're in Agh's Shard Smoke Screen.\nSmoke Screen can be cast during Tricks of the Trade.\nYou can Blink Strike to allies as well as enemies.\nBlink Strike's slow works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nWhen farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Blink Strike onto rather than walking around from camp to camp.

So if you haven't gotten all your neutral tokens yet, avoid last hitting with Tricks, otherwise the creeps will have no chance of dropping a neutral token.\nYou still have collision when you're invisible in Cloak and Dagger, so don't bump into the enemies you're stalking.\nIf you're prowling around a lane that you think might be sentry warded, try intentionally forcing creep aggro while invis by right clicking an enemy hero anywhere on the map. If the creeps aggro you, then they can obviously see you.\nIt's possible to Cloak and Dagger backstab Rosh constantly. You just need a teammate to path as close as possible to Rosh, aggro him out a bit, and then remain as the closest target available to Rosh so he doesn't change aggro to you while you're scratching his back.\nThe Tormentor can't be Cloak and Dagger backstabbed.

Only attacking will reveal Riki.\nCounters\nRikis hate attacking heroes who decide to hold a staring contest rather than run scared. He is practically working with an amplify damage rune from Cloak and Dagger when your back is turned, so if you think you can last the Smoke Screen's duration, turn around and have a chat with him. Most of your attacks will miss, and you're still going to be silenced, but if backup is coming, fight him. All of this is assuming that you're not playing Bristleback, though.\nGood anti-Riki items as a support include pretty much any mid-game support item. Smoke Screen stops you from using spells, not items. Force Staff is the typical pickup, Eul's is good, and Ghost Scepter is good.\nRiki holds a strong grudge against both King Bars. BKB and MKB are good carry items against a Riki because they both allow you to fight in the Smoke.\nAgh's Shard Smoke Screen prevents teammates from targeting whoever is caught in the AoE with spells/items, even if they're debuff immune/BKB'd.\nPractice the buddy system. Riki can't really deal with solo-ganking two heroes at the same time.\nRiki cannot cast Blink Strike or Tricks of the Trade when rooted/leashed.\nKeep your Spidey senses on point. If you notice that your hero is doing some peculiar pathing or stutter stepping for some reason, Riki's probably following you around, gently licking you.\nWhen pushing or Roshing, place a sentry ward in/around/behind your team to make sure Riki isn't hiding and waiting for a big Smoke Screen opportunity.\nDust of Appearance slows invis units. Since the only way Riki can force himself to become visible is by attacking, Dust is usually a huge pain for him to deal with when escaping.\nA ground targeted Gleipnir can catch and reveal an enemy Riki.\nBreaks reveal and remove Riki's Cloak and Dagger invisibility as well as disabling the backstab multiplier."

That split second of targeting your Blink after you teleport in could get you killed.\nYou probably want to have your auto-attack setting on 'Never' when playing Tinker. This reduces your chances of revealing yourself in trees with an errant auto attack onto a nearby lane creep.\nYou can also get in the habit of shift+queueing a stop command after Blinking into trees.\nUsing Soul Ring will always give you a surplus mana buffer, even if your mana is full. So don't use Soul Ring before you TP out of the fountain because the Keen Conveyance mana cost will be taken out of the buffer.\nTake advantage of the few seconds of residual fountain aura when you TP to a creep. If you're fast, you should be able to use a Bottle charge and have it replenished immediately and you should be able to lose minimal HP from Soul Ring's Sacrifice.\nDon't make life hard for your carry. You have the ability to be in all three lanes whenever you want, but you also have the ability to bail at a moment's notice. Much like Nature's Prophet with his Teleportation, Tinker's job is to farm the dangerous locations on the map that other heroes can't. So stay out of the lane that your carry is trying to farm.\nTry and fake Keen Conveyance on nearby targets to scare enemies off chasing your allies even when you don't want to commit.\nIf you target Keen Conveyance on an invisible ally, enemies will see your TP silhouette on wherever the ally was when you initiated the TP. The silhouette won't dynamically update its position, however, it'll visually stay at that initial point until your TP completes.\nYou can target Keen Conveyance onto an ally Underlord's Fiend's Gate.\nYou cannot target Keen Conveyance onto ally ward units (like Venomancer's Plague Wards or Clockwerk's Power Cogs).\nYou can activate a Shiva's Guard while TPing. It takes ~2 seconds for the Blast to fully extend, so cast it after the first second of a TP channel to arrive with an expanded Blast.\nShiva's Guard provides flying vision as it expands. If you're having trouble catching slippery enemies, consider picking up a Shiva's for the vision.\nDagon can instakill most enemy illusions, but not 'strong' illusions like Chaos Knight's Phantasm illusions or Vengeful Spirit's Agh's Scepter Vengeance illusion.\nIn late game situations, remember that Glyph provides invulnerability on your creeps when used. If you need to TP into a fight or want to bait an enemy into attempting to kill a creep, you could use Glyph offensively to save the creep.\nRearm will refresh cooldowns for backpacked items, but you can't use Rearm to bypass the backpack-to-active-inventory cooldown.\nYou cannot Rearm the following items: Aeon Disk, Arcane Boots, Black King Bar, Hand of Midas, Helm of the Dominator/Overlord, Linken's Sphere, Meteor Hammer, Pipe of Insight, Refresher Orb/Shard, or any neutral items.\nRearm grants bonus magic resistance as soon as the channel starts. If you think you're about to die, it may be worth casting and immediately canceling Rearm just to get the bonus magic resistance.\nRubick can't steal Rearm.\nAgh's Shard Warp Flare roots enemies allowing you to cancel TPs.\nHarpoon's projectile cannot be disjointed. However, you can Blink during the Harpoon pull. So, if you see someone trying to Harpoon you, wait until after the projectile connects before Blinking.\nCounters\nFor some reason, lane creeps drop aggro off of an enemy creep if there is a someone TPing onto it. So it's up to you to kill the creep to prevent Tinker's TP.\nCertain abilities can instakill creeps even if they're Glyphed. These include: Doom's Devour, Mirana's Sacred Arrow, Night Stalker's Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night, Pudge's Meat Hook, Hand of Midas, and Dagon. These can be handy to remember in a late game situation if Tinker Glyphs a creep wave while traveling on to it.\nLaser's blind can be dispelled off. Or just get BKB or MKB to mitigate the blind.\nThe Defense Matrix buff can be removed off enemies with basic dispels.\nLotus Orb can be invaluable against the mostly single target damage and control builds a lot of Tinkers go for.\nHarpoon's active is undisjointable. So if you toss the 'poon at Tinker before he Blinks, the projectile will still follow him and drag him to you.\n\"Ooh! They never miss!\" Tinker is a filthy liar. Heat-Seeking Missiles miss. A lot. Ways to make them miss include: Any kind of Blinking, any kind of invisibling (including Smoke), any kind of banishing, and any kind of teleporting. This spell gets more disjointed than an old lady falling down the stairs, which begs the question as to why Tinker hypes their reliability.\nTinker's Agh's Shard Warp Flare projectile can be disjointed.\nClockwerk can be a fairly good counter since he can get vision of Tinker in the trees with Rocket Flare and initiate on him from a far distance.\nZeus's Agh's Scepter Nimbus is basically a global instant stun. That's pretty value against a Tinker.\nYou can consider Dominating a Harpy Scout and flying it over treelines to potentially give vision of an unwitting Tinker.\nRemember that unlike most TPs, Keen Conveyance is a spell. As a result, silences can cancel Tinker's Keen Conveyance TP."

This is useful when dealing with high ground (sieging or defending) since you can keep casting it and canceling it on enemies/creeps to see around them.\nIf Sniper gets a kill, Assassinate's cooldown is refreshed. You don't even need to get the kill with Assassinate, any kill refreshes it.\nAssassinate applies an instant attack in addition to the nuke damage. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers. If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance once the projectile lands.\nYou can activate Take Aim before the projectile lands to get the guaranteed Headshot proc on the instant attack.\nYou can activate Shadow Blade/Silver Edge after the Assassinate projectile is launched to get the backstab damage.\nSince Assassinate deals an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke once it damages a unit.\nThe hero that needs to exploit positioning in lane the most. The Sniper Shuffle is the complex laning dance that involves waddling forward, popping the enemy in the face until you get a Headshot, pissing them off, running backwards, praying that they don't feel like wasting the energy to kill you, waiting for them to retreat, then repeating. The better you are at predicting enemy movement, the better Sniper you can be.\nAgh's Shard Concussive Grenade fully disables enemies during the knockback allowing you to briefly stun enemies and cancel their channels.\nThe self-knockback from Agh's Shard Concussive Grenade allows you to travel up and down cliffs. You can even blast yourself out of a Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nNullifier can dispel the Force Staff buff off heroes. However, it does not dispel the Hurricane Pike pushback buff. If you're trying to escape while Nullified, casting Pike on yourself won't work to create a gap, but Piking an enemy will.\nSniper has higher than average night vision (1400 vs the standard 800). If you only barely see someone at night, chances are they can't see you.\nCounters\nIf you're getting Assassinated, you will have a debuff icon present in your status bar. The shot will get fired when the debuff timer goes around halfway. There are a few ways to evade it:\nSince the spell gives true sight on your hero, it can't be disjointed by traditional invisibility. However, Smoke of Deceit invis is unique and will cancel the targeting or even disjoint the projectile.\nOther disjoints, like from Blinks, will only dodge the spell after the projectile is fired.\nSpells that banish you or make you untargetable will cancel the Assassination cast. You don't need to time it when the projectile is fired, banishes cancel the targeting phase of Assassination. This even includes the very quick banish from a Manta Style activation.\nSpells that grant invulnerability, but don't banish, like Bane's Nightmare or being cycloned in Eul's won't cancel Assassinate targeting, but can potentially dodge the damage from the projectile if you time them right.\nInfused Raindrop can save your life from some early game Assassinations.\nBreak disables Sniper's passive bonus range from Take Aim.\nSniper has higher than average night vision (1400 vs the standard 800). Something to be aware of if you're trying to gank him at night.\nSniper can't cast Agh's Shard Concussive Grenade if he's rooted or leashed."

Your team will always see the Heartstopper debuff in an enemy's status bar regardless of if they have vision of you or not.\nYou get Heartstopper regen stacks off of any unit you kill including buildings, wards, and creep denies. The only exceptions are illusions or the Tempest Double.\nGhost Shroud boosts HP/mana regen given to you from all sources, including teammates. Shroud yourself before a Keeper of the Light Chakra Magic or Omniknight Purification or Mekansm/Greaves or Arcane Boots.\nAlso, Shroud yourself before using a Magic Wand (which is absolutely core on Necro because of Ghost Shroud).\nGhost Shroud makes you immune to physical damage even from spells, such as Juggernaut's Omnislash or Bristleback's Quill Spray.\nYou get permanent Reaper's Scythe stacks off killing illusions, Aegis kills, or Wraith King Reincarnation kills.\nAgh's Shard Death Seeker can be a useful spell to break Linken's Sphere so you can Reaper's Scythe a target.\nMechanically, Agh's Shard Death Seeker hides your hero at the casting location and then moves you to the targeted location once the projectile lands. You're basically Puck Phase Shifted while the Death Seeker projectile is flying.\nThe ending location is determined on cast, so the targeted enemy moving around won't change where the Death Seeker takes you.\nYou remain hidden/untargetable and invulnerable throughout the movement. The invulnerability is relevant because if you're Ruptured by Bloodseeker, you can Death Seeker somewhere without taking any damage. The hide is relevant because spells that go through invulnerability, like Silencer's Global Silence, won't be able to target you since you're hidden.\nYou can use Death Seeker to avoid spells like Disruptor's Glimpse and Kunkka's X Marks, or go through Disruptor's Kinetic Field and Mars's Arena.\nCounters\nYou can't disjoint Death Pulse, so don't bother trying.\nPipe or Glimmer Cape's magic damage barrier can potentially save an ally's life against Reaper's Scythe.\nDazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's Fate's Edict and False Promise, and heroes that can banish a Scythed target like Shadow Demon, Outworld Destroyer, and Tusk are also good counters. A well-timed Bane Nightmare provides momentary invulnerability as well.\nYou can potentially use Wind Waker on an ally being Scythed to save them.\nGhost Shroud can be dispelled the same ways as Ghost Scepter (Oracle's Fortune's End, Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge, Enchantress's Enchant, etc).\nIf you're a carry and you're struggling to right click because of Ghost Shroud, you can get a Nullifier to dispel the ethereal state off.\nRevenant's Brooch allows you to attack ethereal targets, like Necrophos in Ghost Shroud.\nNecro is taking bonus magic damage whenever he's in Ghost Shroud, so try to bait it out before tossing high magic damage nukes.\nSpirit Vessel can prevent him from healing as much. As do Skadi and Shiva's.\nIf you die with 0 charges on your Urn/Vessel, you'll be gifted 1 upon death. This is true even if you die to neutrals/Roshan.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing.\nNecro loves playing against heroes who frequently give Stick charges, especially in lane. Try casting spells from fog since Magic Stick only gives charges if the spell caster is in vision.\nNecro can't cast Agh's Shard Death Seeker while rooted/leashed."

        "name": "Warlock",
        "guide": "Tips\nFor some reason the targeting cursor doesn't show it and the tooltip doesn't mention it, but Fatal Bonds does have a logic to how it chooses secondary Bonds. Basically, it'll search for the nearest unit (any unit, including neutrals and units in fog) within 700 range. Once it finds a valid unit, it'll continue searching for the next closest target within 700 range around the new unit until it runs out of bounces or runs out of targets.\nIf refreshed, Fatal Bonds will attempt to search for new targets that don't have a Fatal Bonds debuff first before reverting back to the proximity rule.\nDamage shared through Fatal Bonds is dealt with the same damage type as the original source of damage. The shared damage calculates reductions (from armor or magic resistance) independently on each target.\nDamage taken through Fatal Bonds can disable Blink Daggers.\n\"Overkill\" damage on Fatally Bonded targets will spread the full damage of the killing damage instance. So if Lina Laguna Blades a Fatally Bonded 10HP ranged creep, the full Laguna Blade damage will still spread to all other Bonded targets.\nYou get a better heal for your buck than the DoT with Shadow Word because healing ignores magic resistance. Warlock's damage/animation/range are so good you could possibly end up being able to deal more net damage by spending the heal on yourself in lane and right clicking the enemy.\nUpheaval is a proactive slow, not a reactive one. This makes it a great area denial spell. You just need to predict where enemies want to go in the next few seconds.\nThis also makes it a good spell for discouraging encounters. If your team is Roshing, don't sit there plinking away with your weak ass auto attacks. Start channeling your slow on a choke point. If you think the enemy team is about to push up high ground, start channeling Upheaval on the stairs. If your teammate is getting chased, cast the circle in front of their path from a safe distance so you can get some charge time on the slow.\nThe Upheaval slow debuff lingers on targets for 3 seconds.\nThe \"Upheaval Attack Speed on Allies\" talent works on summons (like your Golem) and lane creeps.\nIn a pinch, you can try spawning an Imp with Agh's Shard Upheaval on a cliff to help provide vision for a deward. The spawn location is random, but it's worth a shot if you're desperate.\nWhen you drop the Golem on the enemy team and win the fight, remember to keep using it. The Golem is especially good at cutting off a creep wave during a tower push since its Flaming Fist ability deals damage in an AoE.\nDon't feed your Golem, though. It drops a substantial gold bounty.\nYou can use Shadow Word to heal your Golem. You can also use Urn of Shadows to heal it. Hell, you can Salve, Bottle, or even Clarity it too.\nThe stun from Chaotic Offering can disable debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nYou can try to get your allies to cast buffs on your Golem for giggles. Examples: Dark Seer's Surge or Ion Shell, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, Lich's Frost Shield, Magnus's Empower, Invoker's Alacrity, Ogre Magi's Bloodlust, Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, and Mjollnir's Static Shield are a few choice examples that make the Golem especially deadly. Even Dazzle can Shallow Grave the Golem.\nThe Golem has 1800 day/night vision.\nThe \"Summon Golem on Death\" talent won't summon a Golem for an Aegis death, only a real death.\nIf you take the \"Summon Golem on Death\" talent and have an Agh's Scepter, try to backpack your Scepter if you know you're about to die. When you die with the talent, only one Golem spawns, but it'll have the weaker Scepter Golem stats.\nWarlock is a fantastic hero to get a Refresher on since Fatal Bonds and Shadow Word fully stack when Refreshed. Two Chaotic Offerings can be pretty sweet, too.\nCounters\nPay attention to who's Fatally Bonded to you in the late game. You may inadvertently be killing your support who narrowly escaped death while you're busy trying to finish off Rosh.\nFatal Bonds can be dispelled. Offensive or defensive Shadow Words can both be dispelled.\nThe strength of Upheaval's slow isn't determined by how long you've been standing in it, but by how long Warlock has been channeling it. Don't think you can just quickly run into an established Upheaval and get out. The slow lingers for 3 seconds as soon as you touch it.\nBoth of Warlock's Golem's passives can be disabled by Breaks."

It's difficult to consistently keep stacks up on an enemy hero, but the amp does work on Rosh.\nThe Boar does not draw aggro from lane creeps. This means that you can have the Boar spit at an enemy hero all day and they'll have to kill it themselves.\nThe Hawk will draw aggro from lane creeps before 5 minutes. This is definitely not intended behavior, so please let me know when this tip stops working.\nIf you have a Blink Dagger and you're chasing someone, wait to summon your Boar until after you Blink.\nTry to aim Primal Roar like a Burrowstrike if possible. You'll only be able to stun your primary target, but any enemies caught in the line of fire will be disabled, pushed, slowed, and take damage.\nThat's right, units in the AoE are fully disabled during the knockback of the Roar, so you can break channels even if the enemy wasn't the primary target. Handy against Linken's carriers.\nPrimal Roar can be used to stun couriers, but won't damage them.\nCounters\nTake the time to kill the Boar in lane. Use spells on it if you have to. The Boar is what makes Beastmaster an incredibly strong laner and the cooldown is fairly long. Kill it as soon as he summons it and he'll be far less aggressive.\nHeroes with spells that notably affect creeps can be useful at killing Beastmaster's summons. Clinkz's Death Pact, Clockwerk's Battery Assault, Crystal Maiden's Frostbite, Doom's Devour, Enchantress's Enchant, Lich's Sinister Gaze, Mirana's Sacred Arrow, Pudge's Meat Hook, and Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask are a few specific examples.\nNight Stalker's Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night not only allows him to eat creeps, but allows him to eat ancient creeps at night, including ones dominated by Helm of the Overlord.\nBeastmaster's Hawk can be killed just like any other summon.\nWinter Wyvern can turn Beastmaster's army against himself with Winter's Curse."

However, it's still forced movement which can cancel spells like Templar Assassin's Meld, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge, Techies' Blast Off, or a hero hiding in Shadow Amulet.\nCounters\nShadow Strike is not a constant DoT. There's an initial nuke damage when the projectile hits and then a tick of damage every few seconds. Get a quick Bottle sip or Armlet toggle immediately after you take damage between ticks to stay alive.\nShadow Strike's projectile can be completely disjointed by invisibility and blinks.\nYou can deny allies affected by Shadow Strike.\nWatch her Blink animation to determine the direction that she Blinks in. The particle 'trail' always points in the direction that she traveled.\nRoots/leashes prevent Queen of Pain from casting Blink.\nHarpoon's active is undisjointable. If you're trying to catch an escaping Queen of Pain, try timing Harpoon during her Blink animation and the projectile will follow and drag her right back to you.

Watch this instructional video to help solve that problem.\ntl;dw - Use the stop key and use unified unit orders. No one is forcing Plague Wards to constantly attack. Stop them if there are no heroes around, sic 'em all on a creep at the same time to last hit or deny, put them up on cliffs and tell them to shut up so they don't alert an enemy who didn't know you could see them.\nThe \"Unified unit orders\" option is also useful when chasing enemies down with Plague Wards. When you throw one up ahead, don't waste time box-selecting, just issue a unified ctrl+right click on the enemy hero.\nThere are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it. You can use this to potentially hide a Plague Ward for vision. Just be sure to issue a stop command to it so it won't attack anyone walking into the pit.\nPlague Ward attacks apply a half-damage Poison Sting debuff, but the slow is the same value as your hero's Poison Sting.\nPlague Wards have collision and can be used to block narrow paths.\nTry to deny your Plague Wards in lane. Use your other Plague Wards to help deny dying Plague Wards.\nSpam Plague Wards for vision. Seriously. Just slap them everywhere. They're super annoying for enemies to deal with and have 800 day/night vision.\nWhen jungling, try to place your Plague Wards outside of the spawn box so you don't block new camps from spawning. Plague Wards last forever and will not time out before a camp respawns.\nAlternatively, Plague Wards are great for blocking enemy camps.\nVeno is damn good at harassing enemies in the jungle. Plague Wards have great cast range, short cooldown, and last forever.\nThe secondary Noxious Plague projectiles can hit invisible and fogged enemies.\nIf an enemy activates BKB when the Agh's Shard Latent Toxicity debuff is applied, they'll get stunned. Their BKB will still activate, but debuff getting dispelled triggers the stun before debuff immunity kicks in.\nAgh's Scepter Poison Nova deals non-lethal damage.\nRefreshers are pretty useless on Veno since all his debuffs are only refreshed when reapplied, they don't stack.\nCounters\nAlways be on the lookout for opportunities to deny your allies. You can't deny allies under Poison Sting or Noxious Plague, but you can deny allies under Venomous Gale.\nVenomous Gale and Poison Sting can be dispelled.\nIf you dispel Agh's Shard Latent Toxicity, you'll get stunned. Even if the dispel comes with debuff immunity (like activating BKB), you'll still get stunned because the debuff getting dispelled triggers before debuff immunity activates.\nPoison Sting damage is classed as \"HP removal\" so it does not cancel Blink Daggers or consumable healing. You can use a Salve/Clarity/Bottle without fear of it getting canceled.\nYou can't disjoint the initial or the secondary Noxious Plague projectiles.\nIf you're panicking in your fountain because you think you're about to die to Veno's damage, consider a few options:\nBuy a Faerie Fire.\nBuy Blood Grenades.\nBuy a Cloak if you have the gold.

If your timing is godlike, you can even use the travel invulnerability to dodge things like the AoE stun from Phoenix's Supernova.\nTread switching is especially important to utilize on Void. Time Walk restores flat HP, so you stand to benefit a lot by switching to INT Treads for the mana and going back to STR/AGI after rewinding damage.\nTime Dilation makes Void a very annoying counter for heroes with low cooldown or combo spells like, Timbersaw, Bristleback, Invoker, Lina, Kunkka, Weaver, Queen of Pain, all the Spirit heroes, Terrorblade, Phantom Assassin, and Slark (as long as he doesn't Dark Pact the debuff off first).\nTime Lock attacks can proc anything that your normal right clicks do, including another Time Lock.\nBasher/Abyssal passive bashes don't work with Faceless Void. The game won't allow you to have another bash besides Time Lock.\nChronosphere reveals invisible units. If an enemy decided to stop fighting you and Shadow Bladed out, cast a Chrono along the path and laugh when you discover them without any sort of detection.\nDonkeys in the Dota universe have a stronger grip on space and time than most heroes. Chronosphere will not freeze enemy couriers.\nAny units owned by you can move around in a Chronosphere, such as illusions.\nCounters\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast can prevent Void from regaining HP through Time Walk.\nSpirit Vessel reduces the HP Void will gain in Time Walk. Shiva's and Skadi also reduce HP regen.\nVoid cannot Time Walk when rooted.\nThe Time Dilation debuff can be dispelled.\nEul's is one of the cheapest counters to Chronosphere. You should be able to waste a good 2.5s of Chrono time by Cycloning him if you're outside the Chrono or you can use it on yourself if you're about to be Chrono'd.\nWind Waker can also be used to protect an ally in Chrono. However, allies can't move themselves while cycloned. Only a self-cast Wind Waker allows that.\nGhost Scepter can minimize the amount of physical damage you tank in a Chronosphere and later turning it into an Ethereal Blade can help save allies from dying to right clicks in a Chrono.\nVoid can freely walk through any Chronosphere. Keep this in mind if you're playing Rubick or trying to be tricky in Ability Draft.\nThis means that enemy Void illusions created by Dark Seer's Wall of Replica or Shadow Demon's Disruption can also move around in Chronosphere.\nWard units, like Witch Doctor's Death Ward or Shadow Shaman's Mass Serpent Wards, are frozen when inside the Chronosphere. Weaver Swarm bugs will also instantly fall off and Gyrocopter's Homing Missile will explode when it touches the Chronosphere. Techies' Sticky Bomb will just straight up vanish if you cast it into a Chronosphere, however, it can drive into a Chronosphere just fine if you catch a hero on the edge.\nZeus's Nimbus is the one exception since it works normally against Chrono. I guess it... floats over the Chrono or something.\nMonkey King's Wukong's Command soldiers work in any Chronosphere, allied or enemy.\nDespite its appearance, Chronosphere is actually a giant cylinder, not a sphere. You can't pass over it with spells that use the z-axis, like Tiny's Toss. Units will just get stuck on the edge, but in the sky.\nFaceless Void's \"Backtrack\" talent can be disabled by Breaks. It cannot be bypassed by accuracy, like from MKB, because it's not evasion. It's just a chance to dodge any type of damage."

If there's nothing in vision, they'll head to the nearest lane and act like lane creeps. When jungling, try to get vision on the next camp you want to farm as the current camp is being finished off to keep your skellies on the same page.\nConsider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to guide your skeletons to.\nSkeletons won't block neutral creep camps.\nAn emergency Mango can be handy to supplement mana needed to Reincarnate in the early game.\nSometimes it's advisable to sit on the skill point for Reincarnation.

If an enemy is juking into fog, use ground targeting, otherwise Death Prophet may cancel the unit-targeted cast if the enemy escapes vision.\nIf you ground target Crypt Swarm from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nYou can't use two Spirit Siphon charges on one enemy at the same time, but you can have multiple Siphons out at once. If you're getting ganked, try to Siphon all of the heroes chasing you, or neutral/enemy creeps for the HP.\nThe Spirit Siphon heal is independent of the damage dealt. You can Siphon units with increased magic resistance, like siege creeps, Mud Golems, or Warpine Raiders and still heal the expected amount of HP.\nRefresher Orb/Shard restores all Spirit Siphon charges.\nRefreshing and recasting Exorcism won't double up the spell, but instead cause the previous cast to end first, making the ghosts return to Death Prophet and heal her.\nExorcism ghosts deal physical damage. As a result, it does more/less damage based on enemy armor values.\nYour Exorcism spirits will target whoever you right click. You can change targets even if you're disabled/stunned/cycloned.\nWhen pushing undefended towers, stand closer to the tower. This will decrease the amount of time your ghosts spend circling back to you after hitting the structure and allow you to deal more damage.\nA weird random interaction is Exorcism ghosts can kill Techies' Proximity Mines and Venomancer's Plague Wards, but can't damage any other type of ward unit. It's tricky to pull off consistently, but it does happen.\nThe slow from Agh's Scepter Exorcism Ghosts works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nCounters\nSpirit Siphon won't break if you go into fog, but the Siphon itself doesn't provide shared vision of your hero. Death Prophet can still track you by following the Siphon particles, but you may be able to avoid a few right clicks by juking in trees.\nYou can click on her and check her buffs to see the duration left on Exorcism.\nChasing her down mid-Exorcism is a dangerous game. Besides the fact that the ghosts do a lot of damage, it's entirely likely that the ghosts will completely fill up her HP once they're done and she'll just turn around and destroy you.\nDespite being physical damage, Exorcism ghosts ignore damage block and evasion, so Vanguard or Crimson Guard won't reduce their damage. Only armor helps.\nYou can target a hero that has defensively Eul's cycloned themselves with Nullifier to cancel it or you can cast Nullifier on them to prevent Eul's from activating. Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge works similarly.\nSpirit Vessel, Skadi, and Shiva's can reduce the HP regen she'll gain from Spirit Siphon and Exorcism.\nMage Slayer reduces spell damage, meaning it can also reduce the amount of damage dealt from Exorcism."

Learn the projectile's travel times, be able to accurately estimate the damage of the dagger at each level on creeps, and practice timing right clicks+melee range Daggers to make it impossible to deny you.\nIf an enemy in your lane has a Magic Stick, cast your Stifling Daggers from fog whenever possible. Stick only gains charges from spells that are cast in vision.\nStifling Dagger applies damage as an instant attack. This is a unique attack type that ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers. If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance once the projectile lands.\nSince Stifling Dagger is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke once it damages a unit.\nYou can activate Shadow Blade/Silver Edge after the Dagger projectile is launched to get the backstab damage.\nYou can Stifling Dagger a Bane Nightmared unit and they won't wake up.\nAlways be on the lookout for units to Phantom Strike to when you're trying to escape.\nWhen pushing an uncontested tower, you can Phantom Strike onto a nearby enemy creep and use the attack speed buff to siege the tower.\nWhen farming your jungle, consider using your courier to get vision of the next camp to Phantom Strike onto rather than walking around from camp to camp.\nLane creeps and neutrals don't react to getting right clicked by you when Blur is active.\nYou can activate Blur even within the detection radius of enemies if you need a \"fade time's\" worth of invisibility. Meaning, you can activate Blur, be vanished for a very brief period, and use that time to disjoint projectiles or juke enemies.\nBlur follows the same rules as Smoke, but with a smaller radius. Meaning, it will dispel when near enemy buildings (including Outposts) and heroes.\nReflected Blade Mail damage doesn't go through debuff immunity. If you're killing yourself on enemy Blade Mails, consider buying a BKB.\nAgh's Shard Fan of Knives absolutely shreds illusions because the damage calculates off of a target's max HP.\nAgh's Shard Fan of Knives will also be reset if you have an Agh's Scepter on Phantom Assassin.\nAgh's Scepter refreshing cooldowns on kills even works on Aegis deaths/Wraith King Reincarnation.\nCounters\nA Magic Stick may be a smart investment if you're doing a good job zoning her out since she'll have to spam Dagger for last hits.\nIf you're a carry, get a MKB or Bloodthorn for the accuracy to hit her through evasion.\nAttacks proccing Chain Lightning from Maelstrom/Mjollnir/Gleipnir cannot be evaded. Not a huge bump in accuracy, but it's something.\nIf you are a Chen (with Agh's Shard Holy Persuasion) or Doom (with \"Doom Devours Ancients\" talent) or built a Helm of the Overlord, consider getting a blue Thunderhide lizard for the accuracy aura.\nIf you're a support, get a Ghost Scepter or Aeon Disk for survivability. A Pavise could allow you or an ally to survive a few more right clicks with the barrier. If you're tanky, get a Blade Mail so she'll kill herself on you.\nSilver Edge and other sources of Break (like from Viper's Viper Strike) can disable Blur's evasion and Coup de Grace's Deadly Focus crit.\nPA cannot Phantom Strike when rooted.\nYou can dispel Phantom Strike attack speed off of PA. This can make heroes like Shadow Demon with Demonic Purge or items like Nullifier handy counters.\nThe minimap is very deceptive when playing against a PA. You can never be 100% sure of her whereabouts because Blur's active hides her from your minimap.\nBloodseeker can be pretty difficult for PA to deal with since she needs to move around a lot during fights and Rupture really harshes her vibe.\nThe Agh's Shard Fan of Knives break debuff can be removed with basic dispels."

        "guide": "Tips\nNether Blast damages towers and creeps. You don't get bonus damage for engulfing the whole tower, which is what some Pugnas seem to think. Keep the tower on the edge of the Blast AoE and focus the majority of the Blast on the creep wave.\nNether Blast is a great spell to cast and stop-cancel. The animation is extremely obvious, but the lack of any visual feedback makes it difficult for the enemy to tell if you canceled it or not. Eventually they'll call your bluff, at which point you can start getting lazy with your Stop key.\nDecrepify makes you immune to physical damage. You won't even take damage from physical damage spells such as Juggernaut's Omnislash or Bristleback's Quill Spray.\nCheck yourself before you Decrep yourself. In a 1v1 situation you usually want to Decrep the enemy, when there are multiple enemies you usually want to Decrep yourself, when there is a team fight, you should try to save your Decrep for your Nether Ward.\nWhen trying to save allies with Decrepify, be aware of the dispels that are on the field. If the enemy has a BKB, Manta Style, Satanic, Lotus Orb, or Disperser, you're better off Decrepifying your ally to save them from right clicks. If the enemy has a Nullifier, it's probably more reliable to Decrepify the aggressing enemy hero to stop them from attacking.\nLane and neutral creeps will immediately drop aggro if you are Decrepified. If you're sneaking behind enemy lines and a creep is following you, Decrepify yourself and it'll lose interest.\nThis is also extremely useful for tower dives since both the enemy tower and creeps will ignore Decrepified targets.\nIf you use Decrepify on a lane creep, they immediately stop pathing and just stand around for some reason. Not very useful, but you could use this to stall a siege creep before it goes into tower range. You could also Decrepify a creep to save it from tower Glyph attacks.\nDecrepify slows enemies, but not allies.\nDecrepify can be applied to debuff immune/BKB'd allies to turn them ethereal.\nDecrepify can be cast on any target while channeling. Like during channeling Life Drain or a TP.\nRemember that Decrepify amplifies heals. Cast Decrepify on yourself to increase the HP gained from Life Drain.\nYou can Decrepify the Nether Ward, effectively making it invulnerable for a few seconds. You can also Decrepify Undying's Tombstone.\nCast range bonuses, like from Aether Lens, can be pretty cute on Pugna since they allow you to dump your Nether Ward inside trees.\nNether Ward will still zap heroes that are hidden in fog.\nNether Ward will only zap on spells that would give you Magic Stick charges. So an enemy Outworld Destroyer won't get zapped every time he casts Arcane Orb, for example.\nEven though the Nether Ward will constantly zap a Storm Spirit in Ball Lightning, it doesn't deal any damage aside from the initial zap.\nLife Drain creeps to heal yourself up after a team fight. Don't bother trying to regen mana from creeps, though, that part only works on hero targets.\nLife Drain provides true sight on targets.\nLife Drain kills illusions on the first tick, but not 'strong' illusions.\nAgh's Shard Life Drain through Nether Ward can be an effective solution to counter illusion heroes.\nAgh's Shard Life Drain only finds secondary targets on cast. If more enemies walk into the AoE after you've started channeling, Life Drain won't acquire any new targets.\nYou can target Life Drain on allies to heal their HP (or mana) at the cost of your own HP.\nLife Drain's heal is completely independent from the actual damage an enemy takes. So Decrepifying an enemy will only increase the damage they take, but not the amount you'll heal from Life Draining them. Conversely, if you're Life Draining a BKB'd enemy, you'll still heal for the full value.\nThe heal being separate from damage is also true when healing allies with Life Drain. For example, if you put a Glimmer Cape barrier on yourself, you'll fully heal allies while your barrier tanks the damage.\nHoly Locket or the \"Paladin Sword\" neutral item only amplifies Life Drain's heals on the hero receiving the Life Drain. So if you build Holy Locket on Pugna, you're not going to heal allies more with Life Drain, but you will heal yourself more when Life Draining enemies. If your ally has those items, they'll heal more from your Life Drain.\nDecrepify applies a heal amplification buff on allies allowing Life Drain to heal them more.\nSince Life Drain works on non-hero units, you can deny yourself in a pinch by Life Draining yourself into an allied creep.\nCounters\nPugna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game. While he may appear squishy, it's tough for a bootless support to get a lock on him because he's so fast.\nThe Nether Ward will toast you before your spell comes out. The spell won't be put on cooldown if you die, though.\nIf you're in the Nether Ward's AoE, you will see a debuff icon in your status bar even if the Ward is in fog.\nPipe of Insight's Barrier works on buildings to reduce Nether Blast damage.\nSpirit Vessel is a great way to make Life Drain easier to deal with when against a farmed Pugna since he'll heal much less. You can also put it on his ally that he may be Life Draining into to reduce that heal as well. Skadi and Shiva's also reduce HP regen.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing.\nIf you're a carry and Pugna keeps Decrepifying targets that you're going on, get a Nullifier to dispel the ethereal state or get a Revenant's Brooch to attack ethereal targets.\nIf you're a carry and Pugna keeps Decrepifying you, get an item that can dispel like BKB, Manta Style, Disperser, or Satanic."

        "name": "Templar Assassin",
        "guide": "Tips\nThe bonus damage charges you get on Refraction don't get consumed on denial attacks, but you also don't get the bonus damage when issuing deny attacks.\nAll damage sources are created equal on the temple steps. Whether it's a ranged creep, a tower shot, or a thousand damage Phantom Assassin crit, each instance of damage you take will wipe a Refraction charge off. As a TA, it's massively important to learn how to maintain creep aggro to ensure that creeps won't burn off Refraction charges.\nSince the entire damage instance is blocked, Refraction prevents Blink Dagger or consumable regen from breaking if you get hit.\nThe cooldown on Refraction is the same as its duration. Before going in for a gank or joining a team fight, you want a fully charged Refraction to be on the tail end of its timer so you can put a fresh one up when everything inevitably starts going wrong.\nMeld has no cast time and no fade time. This is useful for disjointing spells, tower shots, and right clicks, but it's also huge for juking. When you're getting chased, Meld as soon as you get a moment of high ground above the enemies. If you're juking in the jungle, Meld as soon as you think you're in a split-second of fog. Chances are the enemy will assume you kept running and continue chasing the same direction.\nYou have no collision when you're Melded, so you won't block pathways.\nIf you have trouble landing Meld strikes in the heat of the moment, try using attack+move commands instead of right clicking on the enemy.\nThe armor reduction debuff from Meld works on Rosh. The debuff stacks as well, so you should try to double-Meld Rosh when you first start taking it.\nMelding a unit makes your Psi Blades deal more damage on spill targets since the primary unit will have reduced armor.\nTo be an effective Lanaya, you've got to learn how to play Psi Blades like a concert pianist. A deny could be used to pick up a last hit in the same stroke. A full creep wave should be wiped in two spills after you pick up a Desolator. Move creeps and neutrals in the jungle around to get the perfect spills.\nPsi Blade's spill angle is calculated from TA's position once the attack connects, not from where TA was when the attack was started. It's not much, but you can ever so slightly move yourself around after you attack to change spill angles onto the enemy.\nYou can target your Traps with deny attacks to give a target to spill off of. If an enemy is escaping out of your attack range or vision, try planting a Trap in a line behind them and immediately deny it to potentially spill onto the enemy.\nPsi Blade spill damage can hit ethereal units.\nPsi Blade spill damage can hit invisible units.\nPsi Blade damage can spill through Venomancer's Plague Wards and Techies' Proximity Mines, but not any other types of ward units (other than your Traps). Probably because other ward units require a number of attacks to kill, but these have actual HP.\nYou can give shared control of your Traps to all of your teammates so they can detonate your Traps themselves by opening the scoreboard and clicking the \"Shared Unit Control Options\" icon in the bottom corner. Please notify your teammates that you're doing this otherwise you're going to sabotage their micro.\nThe core early game Trap locations are the runes (or at least one rune), their side of the mid hill, your side of the mid hill, and choke points on stairs. Mid/late game should include Traps on the Twin Gates and the Rosh pits.\nThere are tiny little blind spots on the edge of the Rosh pit entrance that you can only see if you walk right on it. You can use this to potentially hide Psionic Traps from a casual sweep of the pit.\nDamage from multiple Traps won't stack.\nThe last Trap debuff an enemy is hit by will immediately overwrite the previous Trap debuff (for both the slow and damage).\nIf you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Psionic Trap damage. Be sure to account for the Trap slow affecting the neutrals with your stack timings.\nIf you're close to messing up a stack, try using a Trap to slow down the neutrals before they make it back inside their spawn box.\nYou can use Trap damage on lane creeps to split push lanes.\nThe \"Meld Hit Bash\" talent can stun enemies through debuff immunity/BKB.\nTA is an excellent hero to learn Tread switching on since she can make use of all three attributes and frequently gets a Bottle.\nCounters\nIf TA has the damage buff from Refraction, her Psi Blades will be longer and glow redder. Personally, I can't tell the difference and I don't have the time to color match it at Home Depot when I'm dying under my tower, but it's true.\nDamage over time is great at burning off her defensive Refraction charges. Batrider, Jakiro, Phoenix, Venomancer, and Viper are examples of heroes with spells that are great at quickly burning off Refraction.\nItems that apply DoTs like Blood Grenade, Urn of Shadows/Spirit Vessel, and Radiance can also slowly take Refraction instances off.\nSpells that quickly deal lots of little instances of damage like Crystal Maiden's Frostbite, Ember Spirit's Flame Guard, Kunkka's Torrent, Grimstroke's Ink Swell, Nature's Prophet's Sprout, Pudge's Rot, Queen of Pain's Sonic Wave, Razor's Eye of the Storm, Sand King's Sandstorm, Slark's Dark Pact, or Bloodseeker's Agh's Scepter Blood Mist are also good at rapidly shredding Refraction instances.\nCertain spells that add seperate damage instances on right clicks, like Enchantress's Impetus or Spectre's Desolate, can burn off two Refraction charges in one attack. Items with procs like Maelstrom or MKB also work. Diffusal Blade does not add a separate damage instance.\nIllusion heroes (like Chaos Knight, Naga Siren, Phantom Lancer, and Terrorblade) are good at dealing with Refraction since each illusion's attack will remove a Refraction charge.\nYou can't break TA's Meld with any stun or silence since Meld invisibility is an infinite duration undispellable buff, not a channeled spell. Your team really needs to have ground targeted spells or detection (Dust or sentry wards), otherwise she'll just sit there until her Blink comes off cooldown.\nHowever, spells that change her horizontal position with forced movement like Batrider's Flamebreak, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Dark Seer's Vacuum, Drow Ranger's Gust, Invoker's Deafening Blast, Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, Magnus's Skewer, Mars's Spear, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Queen of Pain's Sonic Wave, Spirit Breaker's Charge, or Void Spirit's Aether Remnant can break Meld by moving her.\nKnow what you're getting yourself into if you dive a TA. Can you handle her having Refraction? Do you have detection if she Melds? Will you be able to kill her if she has five Traps lying around?\nAlways be moving around when you're against her mid. Make her miss last hits because she's too busy trying to spill on you.\nIf you activate Glyph, Psi Blades can't Spill any damage off of your creeps. Could be handy to know in a low HP mid lane skirmish situation.\nIf you're mid against Lanaya, get some sentry wards at around 5 minutes. Not only will this allow you to actually finish a gank on her if you get the upper hand and she tries to hide with Meld, but you can also clear the Trap(s) that you know she has on your side of the hill.\nIf you have a spell that she can disjoint in the laning phase with Meld invisibility, it can be worth getting a sentry ward even earlier.\nSmokes are great against teams with a TA since they will often be lazy when spamming observer wards if they can rely on Trap vision. On the other hand, you need to be careful that you're not Smoking on top of a Trap.\nAssume she has a Trap in pit when you're Roshing, so either bring sentries or don't go for sneaky Rosh attempts against a TA.\nRunes are also very commonly Trapped by TA, so she may see you if you're camping the rune before it spawns.\nThe \"Gossamer Cape\" neutral item is an incredibly valuable pickup against Templar Assassin to help evade her Meld attack."

The main purpose of this is to break Blink Daggers instantly when someone damages you.\nThis interaction also has the unintended benefit of applying TONS of damage to enemy heroes that are constantly dispelling the Corrosive Skin debuff while simultaneously re-applying it by damaging you. Examples include a Slark Dark Pact'ing on you or someone damaging you while under Shadow Demon's Agh's Shard Demonic Cleanse.\nThe Corrosive Skin damage application AoE on Agh's Scepter Nosedive is much larger than the disarm AoE.\nAgh's Scepter Nosedive can highlight units in fog and invisible units if you pay attention to the particle effects.\nYou can use Agh's Scepter Nosedive to travel up and down cliffs.\nThe further away you target Agh's Scepter Nosedive, the longer Viper takes to travel to the destination.\nDon't attempt to Agh's Scepter Nosedive through Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Mars's Arena. You'll get stuck on the edge and won't be able to act until their spell ends and your Nosedive finally finishes traveling.\nViper looks funny with high attack speed.\nThat's really all there is to know about Viper...\nCounters\nYou want to avoid putting DoTs on Viper. Every time he takes damage, Corrosive Skin will refresh on your hero if you're in the passive's range. Seeing as how Corrosive Skin is also giving him magic resistance, he'll typically take less damage than you from any DoT.\nThis includes things like Radiance. You should probably avoid building a Radiance against Viper.\nViper Strike's projectile can be disjointed.\nViper can't cast Agh's Scepter Nosedive if he is rooted/leashed."

As a result, the Glaives will ignore evasion and won't proc on-hit effects like Centaur Warrunner's Retaliate. However, unlike other spells, spell damage amp or spell lifesteal doesn't work on Glaives and Glaives are reduced by damage block.\nAgh's Shard Moon Glaives can damage invisible enemies that are in the AoE.\nAgh's Shard Moon Glaives do not apply any attack modifiers.\nThe Lunar Blessing damage aura works on creep-hero units like Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.\nLunar Blessing gives you bonus night vision. If you see an enemy at night just at the edge of your vision, there's a good chance they can't see you yet.\nEclipse is married to Lucent Beam. If for some reason you're keeping Lucent Beam at low levels, Eclipse is going to do less damage.\nEclipse doesn't continue after you die, so don't use it if you're getting ganked just because you're angry that you got caught.\nAgh's Scepter Eclipse (ground or self targeted) ends prematurely if Luna dies. When cast on an ally, it ends prematurely if that ally dies.\nAgh's Scepter Eclipse can be targeted on any allied unit except ward-type units. You can even target it on couriers.\nA ground targeted Agh's Scepter Eclipse only provides a small radius of ground vision, not flying vision, around the center of the AoE. If enemies are hiding behind trees, but inside the AoE, they won't get hit by the Beams.\nEclipse has a fairly long cast time. It's okay to cast it earlier than you need it just so you can get it off before getting perma-stunned.\nSince the cast time is so long, enemies will often be able to evacuate the area before any Beams even connect. Try to cast the spell in a way where the enemy can't easily leave once they see you like from fog, or behind trees, or after the enemy team is fully committed to a fight.\nEclipse turns the map to night for 10 seconds. If you see a bunch of enemies moments away from ganking you and you really don't want to die, you can use Eclipse's night to potentially hide yourself from enemy vision.\nCounters\nLuna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game, so as tempting as it can be to dive her in the early game, it can be risky without disables.\nLuna has 1800 night vision once Lunar Blessing is maxed, so you need to be sneaky if you're trying to gank her at night.\nOnce your tier 3 tower goes down, get ready to enter Glaive City. Not only will this damage everything in sight, but there is a high probability that your Blink Dagger is going to get disabled from an errant Glaive. Stand as far as possible from your structures if you're planning on Blink initiating.\nEclipse can be a terrifying spell, but there are ways to deal with it. Summons and illusions are a good way to mitigate the risk of eating Beams. Blade Mail could potentially kill her if you're tanky."

Poison Touch ticks physically, Shadow Wave heals and deals damage physically, and Bad Juju is all about mitigating armor values. SUCH SYNERGY.\nPoison Touch will only potentially spread to targets in a cone that are within ~500 units of the primary target.\nAgh's Shard Poison Touch is an extremely effective tool for quickly clearing illusions with its hex.\nBe smart about using heals post-Shallow Grave. I'm fine if you Grave someone at 50% HP because at least you're trying. Just don't waste heals on a 1 HP Shallow Graved ally when there are 4 seconds left on the Grave clock. Wait for the ring around them to drop to the ground (that's the visual showing when Shallow Grave ends) and then immediately burst heal them. You're wasting precious healing potential by healing someone who's safe and is going to get that HP burned off during the Grave anyway.\nIf things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like Shallow Grave by clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.\nFor some reason you can Shallow Grave illusions. Mind game potential too strong.\nYou can also Shallow Grave creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings.\nShallow Grave to an immediate TP can get you out of nearly every gank situation early game unless you're against some sort of disable heavy Mirana, Shadow Shaman, Lion lane.\nDazzle has a instance of damage around himself when Shadow Wave is cast.

Stand along the outer perimeter of an enemy hero, rather than bulldozing through the middle of the creep wave.\nAvoid immediately right clicking the enemy hero and drawing creep aggro when you're going in with Battery Assault in lane.\nBattery Assault can't hit invis units, but Power Cogs can. So if an enemy Templar Assassin Melded right next to you, be aware that the shock on Cogs can still hit and bounce them.\nIf you have melee carries and you land a Hook+Cog, deny a Cog so that your teammate can get in to deal damage. Or, just walk in front of your target after Hooking them and Cog shock them towards your allies instead of trapping the enemy inside the Cogs.\nUsing Cogs as an area denial tool is just as useful as locking someone in. Use it to prevent enemies from chasing you or use it during high ground tower defenses.\nWith quick timing, you can activate a Force Staff, cast Cogs, and then end up outside of the Cogs. This is useful when escaping and trying to create a gap between enemies since you won't have to waste time denying one of your Cogs to get out. Or you can just cast Force Staff after putting Cogs up, but that's not nearly as cool.\nIf you're offlaning, consider using Cogs to lock your lane creeps in at the beginning of the game so the waves meet closer to your tower.\nSetting up Cogs right beside an Aegis grave can give you an instant disable when an enemy respawns.\nPower Cogs provides a magic damage barrier for all allied units inside the Cogs. Consider Cogging your creep wave when pushing to give them a free barrier. The barrier buff lasts for the entire Cogs duration, even if allies walk out of the Cogs.\nConsider planting Cogs near your team during high ground sieges to preempt an enemy who's trying to Blink in and initiate on your team. If they do, they may immediately get shocked when they Blink in.\nEach Power Cog gives a small radius of vision. You can try dewarding by spawning a Power Cog on a cliff for vision instead of wasting your Rocket Flare cooldown.\nRocket Flares give vision on detonation, we all know that, but the vision provided during the Flare's flight is just as important. Make a decision whether you want vision of a small area for a long time or a large area for a short time. If you are policing the Rosh pit, detonate the Flare there. If you're trying to get information about where the enemies are during a lull, let it fly all over their jungle and explode somewhere useless. Ideally you can do both in one Flare and get a double kill where it explodes, but that's not always going to happen.\nIn late game situations, consider using Rocket Flare vision to keep track of runes.\nIf you are within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Rocket Flare.\nIn the laning phase, consider using your Rocket Flare to pop an enemy Raindrop from an entirely different lane. It'll 100% trigger them and might even actually be useful for gameplay too?\nA target can get hit by two Agh's Scepter Overclocked Rocket Flares if you target the primary Flare ~200 units or more left/right off center.\nYou can actually hit an enemy with all three Agh's Scepter Overclocked Rocket Flares, but ya gotta get reaaaal sweaty to pull this off. Basically, if you issue a move command, reach the location, and then cast an Overclocked Rocket Flare precisely on the same spot you're standing without moving your mouse at all, all three Flares will explode on top of your hero.\nA slightly easier method for this strategy is to move somewhere while Overclocked, shift+queue Rocket Flare without moving your mouse at all, and then shift+queue a 'stop' command. The shift+queued 'stop' command will prevent Clockwerk from walking around during the Rocket Flares because if he does, it messes with the targeting.\nYou can Hookshot to allied units, neutrals, Tormentors, or Rosh. Keep this in mind if Hook is off cooldown and you're getting ganked.\nHookshot stuns debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nClockwerk will briefly stun everything in his path while flying to a Hookshotted target. Normally this isn't relevant since the only target you'll usually collide with is the one you landed the Hook on. However, if you quickly change your 'starting' location after casting Hookshot with something like Blink Dagger, you can change your trajectory and use your flying body as a debuff immune piercing disable.\nCancel the cast animation for Hookshot with your 'stop' hotkey to bait enemies into juking for no reason.\nYou can interrupt Hookshot from dragging Clockwerk to his target by self-casting Force Staff or Eul's mid-flight.\nYou can cast items while flying in Agh's Shard Jetpack. In fact, you don't even have to turn your hero to target items (or spells) if you cast them mid-Jetpack. You can even TP while Jetpacking.\nYou can channel an Outpost, Lotus Pool, or Watcher while Jetpacking. Just be sure you're happy with the direction you're traveling before you start because you'll have to keep moving in a straight line until the channel completes.\nIf you channel a Twin Gate or Underlord Fiend's Gate while Jetpacking, your hero will stop moving and channel in place.\nCounters\nRattletrap: Professional Salve Assassin. Try to keep Healing Salve/Clarity usage on the down low, even if Clock's not in your lane. That dude will Flare you at the worst possible times.\nRocket Flare is a popular spell to get cross-map kills. If you're low on HP and Clock is far away, pause for a moment once you're in fog to try to evade a potential Flare.\nHookshots are fairly easy to juke if you know they're coming. If you're trying to escape and you just walked into a Flare, stand still for a moment or change your current path trajectory.\nPay attention to the Flare particles. If you're in the Rosh pit and you think you're safe because you haven't gotten hit, Clock may have Flared the area earlier.\nNature's Prophet casting Sprout on a target in Cogs will always shove everyone except the main target out of the Cogs.\nClock's Agh's Shard Jetpack ability can be dispelled."

In lane, there are few things more irritating than seeing a Leshrac go all Napoleon Crossing the Alps, moving so you don't get stunned, and then him canceling the animation. You can also use the cast animation to stun people chasing you without having to turn around by casting it directly in front of your feet.\nWhen munching on a tower with Diabolic Edict, become a zen master of positioning. Just stand in the corner of the AoE so that you're only seeing explosions underneath the tower and give her the Edict. If you don't right click, you won't draw any aggro and the tower will continue attacking whichever unit is closest, which will still be the creeps.\nCertain towers have treelines next to them that you can hide in. Cast Edict while standing in fog and enemies won't even see you show up on their map while you destroy their tower.\nTry to bait out a Glyph when you walk up to a tower before using Edict. Edict has a cast time, so try to cancel it during your T-pose. Most of the time people will just Glyph the second they see Leshrac smugly standing alone by their tower, but it's still worth a shot.\nDiabolic Edict damage fully pierces debuff immunity/BKB.\nEdict will continue damaging the AoE around your corpse even after you die.\nEdict and Pulse Nova can hit invisible and fogged units.

It has an incredibly obvious and lengthy cast animation. It's usually worth running sideways or backwards a small distance just to dodge it.\nAvoid activating Glyph until you see Leshrac giving your towers the Edict. If you Glyph too early, Leshrac may just wait until your Glyph times out and then cast Edict.\nClockwerk makes life difficult for Leshrac since Battery Assault cancels most of his cast animations.\nBlade Mail can discourage Leshrac from soloing you.\nMage Slayer significantly reduces Leshrac's damage output.\nIf you dispel Leshrac during Agh's Scepter Nihilism, the whole aura is canceled and removed.\nIf you're outside the Agh's Scepter Nihilism aura, you can hit Leshrac's ethereal form with Revenant's Brooch attacks."

        "guide": "Tips\nSprout gives a small radius of flying vision around the trees when cast. Use Sprout to scout enemies who are juking in fog, counter ward cliffs, or to get that last hit on the flying courier who just flew out of vision.\nTarget your Sprout during the Teleport animation when you're going in for a gank. You'll cast it as soon as you're in range and have vision of the target rather than fumbling around the moment you get there.\nSprout can be hero targeted. However, you can utilize ground targeting if the enemy has a Linken's Sphere or if you're trying to guess where an invis hero went.\nIt can also be worthwhile to ground target the entire Sprout ahead of the enemy in a chokepoint. Most enemies will have ways to cut through a single tree, but not many can quickly cut their way through multiple trees.\nIf you ground target Sprout from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nYou can Sprout enemy towers to block their vision. This is really only useful if you need to briefly reduce enemy vision around a tower for some reason, like during a dive. Remember that attacking any unit gives that team vision of the attacking unit, so you can't attack a tower without it seeing you.\nYou can also Sprout your team's buildings defensively. However, your towers will still shoot at enemies if you have vision of them, which in turn gives enemies vision of your attacking tower. Defensive Sprouting is mainly useful on buildings that don't attack, like your barracks or your Ancient.\nThat's right, your Ancient. The big ass building you're trying to protect apparently cannot be seen by enemies if you Sprout the middle of it. This interaction could buy you some valuable seconds in a final defense. Defense of the Ancient.\nSprout continues damaging in its AoE even if the trees are destroyed.\nThe \"Sprout Leashes\" talent leash aspect is completely independent of the Sprout trees. If you or an enemy destroys the Sprout trees, they'll still be leashed until they exit the original Sprout AoE.\nCasting Sprout on a target in Clockwerk's Power Cogs will always shove everyone except the main target out of the Cogs.\nAlways carry a TP scroll. A scroll gives you an immediate escape after you finish Teleporting in to snipe a courier, kill a fleeing hero, or cut the creep wave.\nCourier sniping is relevant all game long. Consider buying your own observer wards and planting them in areas that can spot couriers traveling to and from the fountain or secret shop.\n95% of the raising the roof animation for Teleport will stay under the invis granted by Shadow Blade or an invis rune.\nYou can use press the 'stop' hotkey at any point of the Teleportation cast animation to cancel it without putting it on cooldown.\nYou can use Teleportation to mindgame enemies. If you see your teammate is getting ganked, start casting a Teleport right on top of the enemies, even if you only have 10 HP, just to freak them out. The animation is pretty obvious and is long enough that you can easily cancel it.\nWhen ganking in the early game, Teleport into places out of vision like inside trees or behind the lane.\nMemorize the timings of important objectives around the map, like runes, so you can Teleport and steal them from the enemy.\nYou can teleport into the treelines around the enemy base to safely/sneakily plant high ground wards before a siege.\nHow to avoid dying as Prophet:\nStep 1: Run away a little bit.\nStep 2: Cast Sprout on yourself (if you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" option enabled, just double tap the hotkey) so no one can see you during your private time.\nStep 3: Double tap the Teleport hotkey to automatically target the fountain.\nStep 4: Do it all over again in a minute because the enemy never learns.\nTreants are great units for distracting a creep wave. Just send one up ahead to lead the enemy creeps on a wild goose chase while you continue beating on the tower.\nTreants are great units for scouting. Send them on choke points where you don't have vision to keep track of enemy whereabouts.\nTreants are great units for blocking camps. They move fast and are usually too tanky for enemies to kill if you plop them down right before a camp is about to spawn.\nLearn how Wrath of Nature works and how to maximize the damage on high priority targets. It has the same number of bounces at all levels, so you typically want to cast it if you can see heroes on the minimap and at least 2 lanes have creeps fighting at the moment.\nLinken's Sphere blocks the entirety of Wrath of Nature if you directly target the spell on the hero, but does nothing if you ground target Wrath. This means you can globally pop Linken's if you have vision of a target.\nAgh's Scepter Wrath of Nature disarms targets for the root duration.\nCounters\nQUELLING BLAAAAADE. Also Tangoes or Battle Fury. Few spells can lose effectiveness so dramatically as Sprout does from such cheap items. If your ally is Sprouted, be a pal and use one of these to get them out.\nLearn which spells can break trees as well (especially the not so obvious ones like Io's Tether, Leshrac's Split Earth, Lina's Light Strike Array, Undying's Tombstone, etc). These can also come in handy to invade NP's little home when he Sprouts himself to Teleport out. Keep at least 1 Tango or QB item on hand in the mid game if you don't have any of these spells and late game use Force Staff.\nThe \"Light Collector\" neutral item's active can destroy trees in an AoE around you which can help counter Sprout.\nThe buffs NP gets after Teleportation can be removed with dispels.\nKeep a close eye on your courier. You can protect it with the Shield or Speed Burst if Prophet is trying to make a move on it.\nIf you see Wrath of Nature bouncing around, back out of the lane to get out of vision and stay there for a few seconds. If you're wondering how his ult just hit you in the middle of your jungle, either Riki is stalking you or they have a ward.\nSave your stun/silence for the end of his Teleport animation. He's disabling himself for free while he's mid-animation. Let him think that he's going to get out while you're whittling him down with auto attacks, then disable his cast at the last moment.\nProphet faces in the direction that he's Teleporting.

        "guide": "Tips\nVacuum can move invulnerable/sleeping targets. This means you can pull enemies like a Storm Spirit in Ball Lightning or ones that are slept from Naga Song.\nVacuum destroys trees in a small AoE around the target point.\nIf the enemy has spells that can quickly kill your creeps or dispel Ion Shell in the laning phase, cast the spell on their creeps instead. Place one on the enemy melee creep tanking the least aggro from your creeps to get the most damage.\nFor some reason you can cast Ion Shell on enemy heroes. The main use for this would be casting it on enemy melee heroes during tower defenses. They'll either kill their whole creep wave or they'll have to back off attacking the tower.\nDespite being a targeted ability that can be cast on enemies, Ion Shell doesn't interact with Linken's Spheres or Lotus Orbs.\nDon't put Ion Shells on frontline creeps. You want to put it on the 2nd/3rd creep in the wave whenever you're pushing or farming. The first creep in the wave is going to tank the most damage from the enemy wave and will die first.\nIon Shelling invisible allies is hilarious. The damage isn't large enough to show a huge white bar of missing HP building up on an unsuspecting enemy and the purple lines emitting from the Shell don't even appear.\nYou can put Ion Shell on your allies and have them stand on neutral creeps to farm them for you.\nA few tips to make this strategy even more reliable: Neutral creeps will only aggro your hero if you're dealing damage to them within 1800 range. If it's night time and the neutral creeps are sleeping, your ally can stand on neutrals without them freaking out. They'll just sit there and die in their sleep.\nThis also works at day time, but your ally will need to be Smoked and you'll still need to be further than 1800 range away from the creeps.\nYou can cast Ion Shell on creep-heroes like Brewmaster's Brewlings, Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.\nA lot of the time, your allies will benefit from a Surge more than you can. Don't be a scrooge. Surge and Shell your allied Doom to help him catch up to an enemy. Help Crystal Maiden put that ward down without being hassled for once. Let Batrider Lasso drag someone miles away from their team. Watch Spirit Breaker zoom across the entire map in a matter of seconds.\nDon't hesitate to cast Wall of Replica in a 1v1 laning phase situation. It's not the illusion damage that you need, it's having an extra controllable unit that you can put an Ion Shell on that makes it a threat.\nA Wall of Replica across the top of the stairs on a tier 3 tower can instantly discourage a push. I know it feels bad that you won't be able to make copies if the enemy decides not to push, but if you know that you're not going to get good positioning or a good Vacuum, it can be worth it.\nMicro the illusions generated by Wall of Replica. I don't know what their default command is when they're created, but I'm guessing it's something along the lines of: \"Attack useless things.\" As soon as you score a good Vacuum+Wall, order all the units to attack the highest priority target on the enemy team or get them to bully a support out of a fight.\nWall of Replica illusions carry auras just like all other illusions. Sometimes an offlane/support hero on the enemy team is more valuable for their aura rather than trying to get a Replica of the enemy carry.\nWall of Replica can create illusions of invulnerable (but not hidden/banished) heroes. This can be useful against a Juggernaut who is solo Omnislashing you or to make illusions of heroes slept by Naga Song.\nThe \"Defiant Shell\" neutral item can be a cute pickup on Dark Seer if you have an Agh's Scepter. If someone tries to attack you, you'll Normal Punch them in the face even if you're stunned.\nCounters\nIn the early game, as soon as Dark Seer sticks an Ion Shell on a creep, his most powerful offensive spell is on cooldown. Get more aggressive with harassing him when he uses Ion Shell on something other than himself and don't draw aggro from his Ion Shelled creep.\nYou can dispel Ion Shell. This makes Oracle with Fortune's End or Enchantress with Enchant strong lane counters to DS.\nEnchantress can also steal Wall of Replica illusions making her especially annoying for Dark Seer to deal with.\nYou can dispel Surge. This includes dispels from cyclones (like Eul's Scepter or Invoker's Tornado).\nWhen attempting to kill Seer, try to save stuns and disables for AFTER he casts Surge to waste some of the Surge duration.\nIf you're a carry, pay attention to when an illusion is made of you. While you're critting their team for buckets o' damage, your Bizarro counterpart is doing the same to your supports. Do your team a favor and kill your illusion before it zones them out.\nIf you have a Radiance, consider toggling it off if you anticipate enemy initiation for a team fight. After you pass through DS's Wall, you can turn it back on.\nA Boots of Bearing can help your team quickly scatter if you all got Vacuum'd and slowed by Wall.\nMjollnir's Static Shield active has a chance to proc off any damage instance applied to your hero. This includes damage instances from spells. Since Ion Shell ticks damage extremely frequently, it can be a sneaky way to deal damage against Dark Seer lineups."

The goal is to catch him off guard and take the offensive.\nConsider keeping your own sentries if you're a carry and Clinkz is starting to roam.

This even works on ancient creeps that an enemy has dominated with Helm of the Overlord.\nIf you're standing in the Agh's Scepter Void Zone, you can eat ancient creeps with Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night while the map is in daylight.\nYou can eat glyphed lane creeps with Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night. Could be handy to know if an enemy is Boots of Traveling onto a creep and activates glyph to protect it.\nCounters\nVoid doesn't ministun during daytime. You can TP out with no fear if NS is chasing you while the sun's out.\nRaindrops significantly reduce the nuke damage from Void.\nNight Stalker sees as much at daytime as most heroes see at night. If you see him when the sun's out, remember that he only has 800 day vision and may not even know you're there.\nSome heroes also don't mind night time that much. Luna gets bonus night vision with Lunar Blessing, Lycan gets bonus night vision in Shapeshift, Slark has 1800 night vision, Sniper has 1400 night vision, Bane has 1200 night vision, and Spirit Breaker has a night vision talent.\nPhoenix forces the whole map to daytime during Supernova, even taking priority over Night Stalker's Dark Ascension. This can significantly reduce NS's usefulness in team fights.\nCrippling Fear is one of the few silences that Manta Style and other dispels can't get you out of. If you're a hero that relies on spells to escape ganks, you'll likely need a BKB or Force Staff to get out of Crippling Fear silence. Eul's kind of works if you can cyclone Night Stalker and try to walk out of the silence AoE while he's in the air."

Otherwise, casting new Webs past the cap will always destroy the oldest Web.\nShove yourself into the back corner of jungle camps when farming neutrals. This allows you the quickest escape to path yourself down a cliff or behind the trees if an enemy spots you and tries to smash you with a newspaper.\nMultiple casts of Spawn Spiderlings on a single target stack. So you'll get more spiders on a target's death if they have several Spawn Spiderling debuffs on them.\nYou can try destroying a Web after your Spiders converge on a target. This makes your Spiders suddenly have collision again instead of being phased, allowing you to use them to body block.\nYou get new Spiderites on Spiderling denies. Heck, you don't even need to get the deny, just poke an allied creep (including your own Spiders) with a Spiderling and have them die with the Spawn Spiderite debuff. Boom, free Spiderites.\nSpiders can be used to block or stack camps.\nIf you're freefarming your legs off, send some Spiders to patrol nearby areas to scout enemies trying to gank you.\nI highly recommend enabling the console command dota_selection_groups false if you're playing Broodmother or any micro heroes. This allows you to individually tab through each unit, rather than selecting the entire group of units. It makes it much easier to send individual Spiders out on solo missions.\nCounters\nTry to sneak up with your AoE spells. Broodmothers will immediately call their Spiders off as soon as they see Keeper of the Light trot into their lane. Cast something like Illuminate from the fog, however, and you'll be making that paper.\nSome heroes that Brood's spiders don't really bother:\nAxe - Makes life difficult with Counter Helix and Berserker's Call.\nBatrider - Sticky Napalm and Firefly eat you and your Spiders alive.\nBristleback - Quill Spray farms your Spiders easily and he's hard to kill.\nMars - His entire spell kit makes life miserable for Brood.\nCentaur Warrunner - Retaliate makes him difficult to harass with Spiders.\nDark Seer - Ion Shell is irritating to deal with and he has high armor.\nDragon Knight - Spiders barely scratch DK with Dragon Blood armor and Breathe Fire will incinerate them.\nEarthshaker - Can easily farm Spiders from a distance and can Slam Brood into kingdom come if she's bunched up with them.\nGrimstroke - Stroke of Fate can instagib an entire Spider army and maybe even Broodmother herself with the stacking damage.\nKunkka - Tidebringer shreds your Spiders and you can't easily escape from his X-Torrent-Boat combo.\nLegion Commander - Overwhelming Odds obliterates Brood's entire army from a mile away and she'll have a chance to proc Moment of Courage off every Spider.\nStorm Spirit - Has high natural armor and Static Remnant is cheap enough to spam against Spiders.\nTidehunter - Anchor Smash is tough to deal with and he's crazy tanky.\nTimbersaw - Difficult to kill with Reactive Armor, has tons of AoE to kill Spiders.\nSpirit Vessel, Skadi, and Shiva's heal reduction aspects can reduce the amount of HP she'll gain from Insatiable Hunger.\nGhost Scepter can buy you a few valuable seconds of not getting eaten alive by spiders."

Try hitting a non-Tracked unit first (like a creep) to reach a distant target.\nManually casting Jinada on an enemy hero will not draw aggro from creeps.\nShadow Walk has a visible cast animation even if you're already invisible when you cast it. If your invis is about to run out and you're quietly following someone, run into the fog to recast it, otherwise the enemy hero will see a random dust cloud appear at your location.\nLike all invis spells, you can cast Shadow Walk while you're channeling a TP.\nAlso like all invis spells, you can pick up, drop, or attack items without losing invis.\nYou can dispel Dust detection (after you walk out of the AoE) with basic dispels, like from Eul's Scepter, Guardian Greaves, Lotus Orb, or Disperser.\nIf you're prowling around a lane that you think might be sentry warded, try intentionally forcing creep aggro while invis by right clicking an enemy hero anywhere on the map. If the creeps aggro you, then they can obviously see you.\nBe sure to save Shadow Walk's cooldown for near the end of a gank. If you use it immediately, the enemy will just be able to TP out because you have no more stuns.\nCasting Track doesn't break Shadow Walk invisibility.\nCasting Agh's Shard Friendly Shadow doesn't break Shadow Walk invisibility, can be cast while channeling, and Bounty Hunter doesn't have to turn to cast it.\nYou can cast Agh's Shard Friendly Shadow on untargetable allies, like a Dark Willow in Shadow Realm or an ally affected by Riki's Agh's Shard Smoke Screen.\nAll attacks from your hero on a Tracked target have a crit multiplier.\nHover over the Track debuff icon on an enemy to see how much gold they have. You can alt-click the debuff to announce it to your teammates.\nYou can earn Track gold off Aegis deaths.\nCounters\nEul's, Guardian Greaves, Lotus Orb, Manta Style, Satanic, and Disperser can all dispel Track. Allied targeted dispels like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Legion Commander's Press the Attack, and Oracle's Fortune's End also work.\nPay attention to your buff icons when there's a Bounty Hunter on the enemy team. You can't see the giant flare when it's on you, but you can see the Tracked icon in your debuffs.\nWatch your courier. Watch the path it takes when it's coming to you, watch the path it takes going back, route it over trees, don't send it over commonly warded cliffs, conduct your business quickly at the secret shop, know when the shield and speed bursts are available, and don't let Bounty constantly snipe your donkey.\nBounty Hunters love stealing Wisdom runes. If you're super next level, consider stunning the ground near the Wisdom rune right before it spawns. You may stun an invisible Bounty Hunter who's waiting to swipe your rune.\nTrack gold adds up quickly and is what allows teams with softer carries than yours to wipe you out. Bounties LOVE trades because even though it seems like a 1:1 kill, it's more like a 1.5:1 gold kill.\nBounty Hunter is at his strongest in the mid game when teams are separated and still squishy, so take initiative with detection (Dust or sentry wards). As opposed to other invis heroes like Clinkz or Nyx, Bounty doesn't get any bonus move speed from his Shadow Walk, which makes him easy pickings if you Dust him or if he bumbles into a sentry warded area."

        "guide": "Tips\nSwarm has a ridiculously long cast range making it a choice spell for scouting Rosh attempts or finding people hiding in the jungle.\nHurricane Pike can be a cute pickup on Weaver since you can Swarm an enemy, Pike them, and still have the bugs keeping vision of your target no matter how far you are.\nSwarm bugs draw tower aggro, making it a smart choice to Swarm someone before diving them.\nIt's extremely easy to time Swarm casts during pushes. Just look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where your creeps are. If they're about to get into tower range, cast Swarm.\nIf you cast Swarm on a siege creep, it will immediately lose interest in the tower it's attacking and aggro your beetle instead.\nSwarm bugs work on Rosh.\nSwarm bugs persist on enemies even if they get cycloned or banished.\nLike with other invis skills, you can cast Shukuchi while channeling a TP.\nIf you're chasing someone down, don't break Shukuchi immediately after passing through them. Use the remainder of the bonus speed to walk in front of them before you start attacking.\nPractice landing last hits off of the Geminated attack, rather than the initial one. If you're having trouble with the projectile timing, just stand right next to the creep and it'll feel like you have double damage. If you don't need help last hitting, use Geminate procs exclusively for harassing enemies.\nManually casting Geminate Attack on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.\nGeminate Attack procs on all enemy ward units. This makes Weaver effective against things like Undying's Tombstone, Pugna's Nether Ward, Phoenix's Supernova, Gyrocopter's Homing Missile, or Clockwerk's Power Cogs.\nTime Lapse before casting Shukuchi. This is like the biggest mistake beginner Weavers make since they'll quickly realize they got all their HP back, but now their escape spell is on cooldown.\nThat being said, Time Lapse does have a cast time, Shukuchi does not. If you're confident that the enemy has no detection or AoE spells to finish you off, just Shukuchi out.\nUse Time Lapse liberally in lane. This ain't a Wraith King Reincarnation, Time Lapse only has around a minute cooldown early on.\nYou can even TP back to base, do some quick shopping/pick up a Salve or Clarity, then Time Lapse to come back to the lane.\nTime Lapse HP gain will work even if you're Ancient Apparition Ice Blasted.\nKeep in mind that Time Lapse doesn't always add HP/mana, it just rewinds your values to whatever they were 5 seconds ago even if they were lower than your current amounts.\nTime doesn't tick down for Time Lapse even if you're dead. You can Time Lapse the moment you spawn after being dead for 40 seconds and show up to where you were 5 seconds before you died.\nThis ties into the whole 'buyback insta-Time Lapse' tactic. It's a dangerously cheesy strategy, but it works sometimes. If you got bursted down super quick, you may come back to when you had full HP.\nThis rule does not apply to Agh's Scepter Time Lapsing allies. You won't reposition them to where they were before they died. I'm pretty sure this is for anti-griefing purposes.\nTime Lapse disjoints projectiles and applies a strong dispel on cast.\nAgh's Scepter Time Lapsing an ally won't break their channels. Useful for cheese strats with an Enigma or Witch Doctor, or if you're just trying to save someone who's TPing.\nCounters\nRaindrops can significantly reduce the damage you'll take from Weaver Shukuchis in lane.\nDust of Appearance is extremely effective at dealing with Weaver's Shukuchi invisibility.\nTry not to reveal you have a sentry ward in lane. Weavers Shukuchi deeeeep into creep waves whenever they're trying to get the nuke damage, but they won't do that if they know you have detection. Let Weaver get complacent before you try to go for a kill.\nSilences and stuns go a long way when when dealing with a squishy, evasive hero like Weaver."

        "name": "Jakiro",
        "guide": "Tips\nDual Breath can hit targets farther than the max cast range of the spell, so stick to ground targeting if you're trying to damage an enemy that's escaping.\nIf you ground target Dual Breath from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nWhen casting Dual Breath, the slow 'ice' breath is released first, then the DoT 'fire' breath shortly after. So be aware that an enemy may be able to react to the first Dual Breath and Blink Dagger out.\nSince Ice Path has a lot of 'active time,' you can use it to preemptively disable enemies. This is good against things like Puck's Phase Shift, Io's Relocate, heroes who are cycloned, or heroes who are TPing in to defend a structure.\nIce Path gives vision. Use it to scout high ground or the Rosh pit or cliffs when dewarding.\nIf you're getting chased by a melee enemy, just cast Ice Path in front of yourself and walk through it. Jakiro's turn speed and long cast animations make it easy for an enemy to dodge it if you cast it behind yourself when they're so close to you.\nCasting Ice Path on an Aegis reincarnation will instantly stun the enemy when they respawn.\nLiquid Fire slows down tower attack speeds and is what makes Jakiro a great pusher.\nTry to save Liquid Fire exclusively for the enemy hero in lane. Since it has an AoE, it can very quickly change the lane equilibrium if you cast it on creeps.\nManually casting Liquid Fire on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.\nYou almost never want to keep Liquid Fire on autocast. When manually casted, you have 600 'cast range,' but when on autocast, it uses Jakiro's default 400 attack range. Why? Hell if I know. This game sometimes, I swear.\nEven if your attack misses, Liquid Fire will always apply its effect on the target and the AoE.\nAgh's Shard Liquid Frost will also apply its effects on the target if the attack misses.\nNo one likes fighting in a Macropyre. So if you don't want to fight, throw out a Macropyre. You can use it preemptively on your high ground if your teammates are dead to kill off the creep wave. It's not a big enough ult that it matters if you blow it, but it's annoying enough to discourage pushes.\nMultiple instances of Macropyre do not stack with each other. If you have a Refresher, you're better off casting the second Macropyre somewhere else.\nThe slow on the ice walls from Agh's Scepter Macropyre works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nCounters\nIce Path has a long cast animation, but insane range. If you're running away from a gank, keep your camera on Jakiro to see if/when/where he is casting an Ice Path. The margin for error for him increases dramatically the further you get, but the stun will stay the same if you're caught in it or walk into it.\nJakiro slows attack speed like crazy. Even between a level 1 Liquid Fire and a level 1 Dual Breath, you're losing a ton of attack speed. Beware if you like to play aggressive and you're a right clicker.\nWhen Liquid Fire is off cooldown, the fire head starts glowing with dripping fire and Jakiro will use the fire head for all attacks until Liquid Fire is used.\nDon't stand next to your tower when farming under the tower. It's scientifically proven that Jakiro players get highly aroused if a single Liquid Fire attack lands on both a hero and a tower."

The difference between 2 stacks and 4 stacks can be the difference between suggesting the enemy eat a Tango or go back to the fountain.\nEnemies only get Magic Stick charges if you're in vision when the spell is cast. Try to cast Napalm from fog as often as possible.\nSticky Napalm gives flying vision around its cast point. Keep this in mind if you need to check the Rosh pit, high grounds, cliffs for wards, or are trying to find a juking enemy.\nSticky Napalm deals half damage to ancient creeps.\nYou can stack neutral camps with Sticky Napalm damage to draw aggro.\nYou can click on an enemy hero to see how many Magic Stick/Wand charges they have. If they're sitting on like 10, it's probably a bad idea to go for a kill.\nNapalm is relevant all game long because turn speed is relevant all game long. Just because you're not laning anymore doesn't mean you should stop using the spell. It still gives vision, it still raises your damage, and enemies will still find it annoying as hell to turn in molasses.\nSticky Napalm has rules against proccing on most item DoTs from Batrider (no Blood Grenade, Urn/Vessel, Orb of Venom/Corrosion, or Radiance), but Meteor Hammer, Witch Blade, and the \"Dragon Scale\" neutral item do benefit from Sticky Napalm damage.\nPay attention to the buff icon timer for Firefly. When it ends you need to make sure you won't be stuck somewhere you don't want to be.\nEnemies can see your Firefly trail even when you're under Smoke.\nEven if you die, your Firefly trail will remain for its full duration.\nFirefly doesn't deal damage to Roshan.\nDon't feel obligated to drag someone as far as you can when you Flaming Lasso someone. If your team is nearby or you're 1v1ing, your time may be spent better trying to lay on additional Napalm stacks.\nIf your team applies fears (like Dark Willow's Terrorize, Lich's Sinister Gaze, or Lone Druid's Savage Roar) on a Lassoed target, they will instantly break the Lasso.\nSources of forced movement (like Marci's Dispose, Pudge's Meat Hook, or Eul's Scepter) have no movement effect on a Lassoed target.\nIf you have Primal Beast on your team and you attempt to Lasso an enemy he's Pulverizing, your Lasso will go on cooldown without doing anything.\nWith Agh's Scepter Lasso, Linken's Sphere can be bypassed if a target is the secondary Lasso, not the primary Lasso.\nCounters\nBuy a Magic Stick ASAP against this fool to take advantage of Sticky Napalm spam in lane.\nOnce you get 3-4 stacks of Napalm on you in lane, back off and let the debuff time out. You can check how many stacks you have by looking at your current debuffs.\nActivating Phase Boots on melee heroes can improve your turn rate when dealing with Sticky Napalm.\nBanishes won't save an ally from getting dragged by Batrider's Lasso. You may be better off banishing the Batrider so he can't move.\nUndying's Agh's Shard Tombstone does protect an ally from getting dragged by Lasso, however. GRAB ALLY.\nKunkka X Marks Returning a Lassoed target will immediately cancel the Lasso.\nLone Druid's Spirit Bear Agh's Shard Fetch can cancel Lasso if it's cast on the same target after Lasso.\nDon't hug the nearby tree-line when defending tier two towers.

Only creeps that have spawned after the minute mark will have the higher level spell. Any creep that was born before the 15/30 minute mark, including ones you've already Persuaded, will be stuck at the same spell level.\nLearn the abilities and auras of neutral creeps and figure out which one best matches your playstyle at various points of the game.\nEarly game, consider getting the big Ghost for move speed slow or big Harpy for Chain Lightning nukes.\nThe Vhoul Assassins give you heal reduction on attacks, but it only reduces HP regeneration, not heals or lifesteal. This can be situationally useful against heroes like Io, Morphling, Timbersaw, or other heroes that buy HP sustain items early on.\nFor mid game fights, the blue Centaur or Mud Golems provide useful stuns or the little Troll with its Ensnare. Other options could be the goblet Kobold for the move speed aura or the Dark Troll Summoner for its Skeletons' Rally aura for pushing. Remember that the Skeletons' Rally aura buffs damage for all allied creeps/summons/heroes.\nThose spear disarm Kobolds seem pretty silly, but did you know they can disarm towers? That's right, you can even stop a glyphed tier 2/3 tower from multishotting if you poke it with the third disarming attack from this little guy.\nThe orange Ogre Bruiser stun lasts a long time, but the windup is insane. If you can get some other stun creeps to setup for it, though...\nThe Harpy Scout can see into the Rosh pit with its \"Take Off\" active.\nThe Harpy Stormcrafter has 1800 night vision.\nLate game, the Alpha Wolf can be valuable for the crits and damage aura.\nSituationally, some other creeps can also be useful. The easy camp shield Troll gives you a passive that breaks, the small Ghost gives you an undisjointable silence, the small white Satyr gives you a dispel that can be cast on enemies and allies, and the small Wolf lets you reduce enemy total attack damage. The blue Ogre Ice Armor can be useful defensively. The healing Hill Troll provides a Heal Amplification aura which can boost Hand of God on allies.\nThe Wildwing Ripper Hurricane ability can let you pull allies out of Faceless Void's Chronosphere and Enigma's Black Hole. Doesn't work against Disruptor's Kinetic Field, Mars's Arena, or leashes.\nIf you buy Agh's Shard, some ancients worth considering are the small Frostbitten Golem for the cooldown reduction aura, big Granite Golem for the max HP aura, the big yellow Thunderhide lizard for the attack speed buff, or the blue Thunderhide lizard for the accuracy aura.\nMultiple casts of the Ice Shaman's Icefire Bomb don't stack, they just refresh the debuff.\nWhen a Mud Golem dies, it will instantly split, but you will still have control of the Shards. You can use this to stun an enemy with the Mud Golem, Persuade a lane creep to force the split, and then have two more Shard Golem stuns.\nWhen either of the Hellbears die, they give all allies in an AoE a buff. You can kill them on demand by Persuading a new unit once you're at the max amount of Persuaded creeps.\nPersuaded enemy lane creeps will benefit from the Glyph invulnerability.\nMartyrdom goes on cooldown for all existing Persuaded creeps on cast. However, if you Persuade a fresh creep after casting Martyrdom, the new creep will have it off cooldown immediately.\nWhen looking around the jungle for useful creeps to take, consider using your courier for vision to help scout out camps.\nRemember that using Twin Gates costs mana on all units that pass through, including your creeps.\nIf you cast Divine Favor on yourself, all your creeps get teleported to your hero.\nIf a unit being teleported under Divine Favor takes damage from a player, the teleport will be canceled.\nDon't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in the lane and try to pick up last hits or send them to neutral camps and start stacking.\nYou can hold ALT to see all your allies current HP under their top bar portraits. Useful if you need to keep your camera on one part of the fight, but want to make sure you can time Hand of God if someone's about to die.\nCounters\nConsider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.\nDagon instakills non-ancient creeps.\nHeroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Clinkz's Death Pact, Clockwerk's Battery Assault, Crystal Maiden's Frostbite, Doom's Devour, Enchantress's Enchant, Lich's Sinister Gaze, Lifestealer's Infest, Mirana's Sacred Arrow, Pudge's Meat Hook, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, and Night Stalker's Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night are a few specific examples.\nDamaging a unit that's being teleported under Holy Persuasion cancels the teleport."

        "guide": "Tips\nSpectre gets a 1 second grace period of collisionless pathing after walking off a Spectral Dagger trail. So if you're trying to escape and don't need to create a huge gap, you can toss the Dagger at your enemies to slow them and then escape backwards over a cliff or across some trees.\nSpectral Dagger gives shared vision on every enemy that get hits by the projectile. This allows you to get basic vision on invis enemies.\nIf your hero is within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it if you damage the camp, like with Spectral Dagger. Any further away and neutrals won't aggro your hero when damaged and just keep sitting in their camp.\nSpectral Dagger can't be reflected by Lotus Orb and completely ignores Linken's Sphere for the primary target.\nIf you unit target Spectral Dagger, only secondary targets in the path's way will get their Linken's popped. If you ground target Spectral Dagger, no Linken's can get popped.\nSpectral Dagger attempts to apply an instance of Desolate on targets hit. If you can, ideally wait to cast Dagger on a target when they're not near allies to get the Desolate proc.\nDesolate damage is added as a separate damage instance from your actual right click.\nWhen farming neutral camps, kill the smaller creeps first. That way you can proc Desolate damage on the big creep.\nDispersion reflects damage before any reductions are calculated. This means it will deal damage before calculating any armor/magic resistance/barriers.\nSpectre doesn't have a farming steroid like most carries. However, Shadow Step allows her to perpetually farm lanes or split push since she can instantly participate in a team fight on demand.\nYou can use Reality multiple times during a Shadow Step cast.\nIf a target dies, the corresponding Haunt illusion will vanish as well.\nYou can potentially outplay this mechanic by Daggering and whittling down an enemy with your hero and then Reality'ing their Haunt illusion back in to take the last hit with Desolate damage. That way you can quickly return back to where you were farming after killing an enemy without having to TP.\nCasting Agh's Scepter Haunt can be a handy way to break enemy initiator Blink Daggers even if you don't have vision of them.\nCounters\nSpectral Dagger creates a trail on invis units if you took damage from the spell.\nHaunt illusions have free pathing, but can be slowed and stunned.\nThings that instantly kill illusions like Disruptor's Glimpse, Lion's Hex and Mana Drain, Pudge's Meat Hook, Pugna's Life Drain, Shadow Shaman's Hex, Dagon, and Scythe of Vyse (Hex) also instagib Haunt illusions.\nWhenever she Shadow Steps, stand next to your creeps or give your teammates a hug. For most of the early to mid game her only Haunt illusion damage is coming from Desolate, so don't let it proc.\nThe Break mechanic, like from Viper's Viper Strike or Silver Edge, is useful against Spectre to disable her Desolate and Dispersion.\nMage Slayer reduces all spell damage from enemies, potentially making it useful at mitigating Dispersion or Desolate damage from Spectre.\nSpectres generally don't like building BKB or MKB, so magic damage and evasion may prove to be more useful against her compared to other carries.\nIf you have a spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting, be cognizant that different styles of casting the same spell may reveal you through fog. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nFor example, say you're a Lion using Earth Spike on a creep wave from fog to farm. If you directly target a creep, you'll be briefly revealed through fog and Spectre may immediately Shadow Step on you. If you ground target, you'll remain hidden."

Use it to scout out Rosh attempts or to check high ground or to help with counterwarding.\nIce Vortex is a great spell to use to stack camps because of its ludicrous range and cheap mana cost.\nManually casting Chilling Touch on enemy heroes won't draw creep aggro.\nIce Blast is a great way to disable enemy Blink Daggers for an extended period of time. You don't even need to land the Blast, as long as they get the Frostbitten DoT debuff an enemy's Dagger will stay broken for the whole duration.\nShoot your ult further than you think it should go in most short range encounters. The Shatter debuff can be more useful than the nuke in some situations and as long as an enemy is along the path of the projectile, they'll get Frostbitten. Plus, the Ice Blast projectile travels slow as hell at low ranges and it's very easy for people to outrun it the second they see it.\nCounters\nHis ult is famous for having Dota 2's most complicated tooltip.

Just you sitting and praying that you don't drop below the Shattering threshold.\nThe exceptions to the no-HP regen under Ice Blast rule are: Lone Druid's True Form, Terrorblade's Sunder, Undying's Decay, and Weaver's Time Lapse.\nIf you're walking back to the fountain at low HP and an enemy AA is alive, take a short break and try to bait the Ice Blast. It's worth spending a few extra seconds standing somewhere else in your base rather than risking getting Blasted in your fountain.\nIf you're too impatient to wait, you can go into your fountain and buy a cheeky Raindrop. If the Blast lands, it may save you, if it doesn't, sell it back.

This can be situationally useful against heroes like Huskar, Io, Morphling, Timbersaw, or other heroes that buy HP sustain items early on.\nMid game, the blue Centaur or Mud Golems provide useful stuns or the little Troll with its Ensnare. Other options could be the goblet Kobold for the move speed aura or the Dark Troll Summoner for its Skeletons' Rally aura for pushing.\nLate game, the Alpha Wolf can be valuable for the crits and damage aura.\nSituationally, some other creeps can also be useful. The lance Kobold gives you a passive that disarms, the easy camp shield Troll gives you a passive that breaks, the small Ghost gives you an undisjointable silence, the small white Satyr gives you a dispel that can be cast on enemies and allies, and the small Wolf lets you reduce enemy total attack damage.\nThe Wildwing Ripper Hurricane ability can let you pull allies out of Faceless Void's Chronosphere and Enigma's Black Hole. Doesn't work against Disruptor's Kinetic Field, Mars's Arena, or leashes. It can also be self-cast to move yourself into a better position.\nIf you take the \"Devour Can Target Ancients\" talent, some ancients worth considering are the small Frostbitten Golem for the cooldown reduction aura, big Granite Golem for the max HP aura, the big yellow Thunderhide lizard for the attack speed buff, or the blue Thunderhide lizard for the accuracy aura.\nIf enemies are picking up Linken's, find a neutral spell that is targeted to pop them before casting Doom. The longest range targeted neutral spell is the Harpy's Chain Lightning and the Mud Golem's Hurl Boulder is a close second.\nYou can Devour creeps that are Glyphed.\nDoom has a pretty long cast animation. It can often times be more reliable to initiate with your Infernal Blade attack+stun as opposed to blinking in and trying to get a raw Doom off first.\nAgainst heroes with high evasion, you may want to consider building a Witch Blade. Witch Blade gives true strike on its debuff attack, so you can use it in conjunction with Infernal Blade to give some cheap accuracy.\nDOOOOOOOOOOOOOM silences enemies, prevents them from healing, and dispels them on cast.\nSelf-casting Agh's Scepter Doom doesn't actually Doom yourself. You just walk around with a Doom AoE.\nCounters\nPay attention to what creep ability Doom has by clicking on him. Don't get surprised when his team rushes out of nowhere because he has the Kobold aura or if he breaks your channel because he took a Centaur Stomp stun.\nIf Doom uses Infernal Blade on you and doesn't have a neutral spell that can cancel channels, you can TP out even if you're Doomed.\nLinken's Sphere is the textbook anti-Doom item. Lotus Orb is also good for offensive situations.\nJust be aware that Doom can counter these single target defensive items by building Agh's Scepter."

        "name": "Ursa",
        "guide": "Tips\nUrsa can Earthshock to jump up or down cliffs and out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nYou consume Overpower stacks on denial attacks.\nThe duration on the Overpower buff is longer than the spell's cooldown. Meaning that before you go in for a gank or into Rosh, you should cast Overpower well in advance so a second cast is already in the chamber when you need it.\nWhen laning, try to keep Fury Swipe stacks up like you would Batrider's Sticky Napalm, especially against melee heroes. Ursa has very high base armor, so it can be worth tanking creep aggro to maintain Fury Swipe stacks.\nCasting Enrage applies a basic dispel on your hero. Use it to wipe off DoTs, or slows, or blinds, or roots.\nAgh's Shard Overpower does not apply the Enrage dispel.\nIf you get an Agh's Scepter, Enrage becomes a strong dispel allowing you to remove stuns as well.\nIf you're already in Enrage, Agh's Shard Overpower will add bonus duration to the Enrage.\nTAKE THE ROSH TIMER WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING THIS GRIZZLY-ASS, POLAR-ASS, BROWN-ASS, BLACK-ASS, GIANT-PANDAS-ARE-ALSO-A-MEMBER-OF-THE-BEAR-FAMILY-ASS HERO.\n\n      bind b \"chatwheel_say 57\"\n\nEnable the console and paste that command in and you can note the time whenever you press B or whatever hotkey.\nIf you're too lazy to do that, then alt+click on the clock or enable 'Current Time' in your chat wheel. If your team has a habit of pinging things constantly and you think you'll lose the Rosh time, just type the time in the chat and press Ctrl+A and Ctrl+X/Ctrl+C to preserve it in your clipboard.\nI legit can't stress enough how important it is to keep track of Rosh as an Ursa, so as a third tip you can also use:\n\n      dota_hud_chat_history_lines 40\n\nThis allows the chat history to scroll up further. Just be aware that increasing the number too much will make your game lag every time you open chat.\nUrsa is also very good at taking Tormentors solo.\nThere's a secret item in the game called Block of Cheese. You make it by combining 18 Healing Lotuses and 1 Cheese. Will this ever happen in a game? No. But it's cool to think about.\nCounters\nUrsa has no stuns, so keep your finger on your TP when you see him bearing down on you.\nUrsa gets bonus status resistance while in Enrage. So if possible, try to save your disables for when Enrage ends, rather than during the buff.\nThe red Enrage visual on Ursa is pretty deceptive. He actually grows when Enrage is active and starts shrinking back down once it wears off. The red visual lingers for around one second after the Enrage buff ends.\nYou really need at least one Force Staff on your team against Ursa, preferably more. After that, Eul's, Scythe of Vyse, Aeon Disk, and Ghost Scepter are all good support items against Ursa.\nEul's cyclone duration doesn't get reduced by status resistance which makes it a good counter against Enrage.\nHeaven's Halberd and Ethereal Blade can briefly prevent Ursa from slicing up your team.\nUrsa can dispel himself with Enrage. Heroes with undispellable abilities like Invoker's Deafening Blast, Viper's Viper Strike, or Bloodseeker's Rupture are quite useful. Enrage also can't dispel the Heaven's Halberd disarm.\nUrsa's Agh's Scepter allows him to Enrage out of stuns (similar to Abaddon's Borrowed Time), but he still won't be able to ult when hexed or silenced.\nYou can dispel Overpower stacks off of Ursa, making heroes like Enchantress (Enchant), Oracle (Fortune's End), and Shadow Demon (Demonic Purge) fairly useful.\nShadow Demon is especially useful since Enrage can't dispel Demonic Purge. So not only are you slowing Ursa to a crawl, but Overpower will get insta-dispelled if he casts it. Just try to cast Demonic Purge on Ursa before Enrage is active, otherwise Enrage's status resistance will reduce the duration of the debuff.\nApplying Nullifier on Ursa is also useful for the same reasons.\nBreaking Ursa only stops him from adding new Fury Swipe stacks, it does not stop him from getting bonus damage from existing stacks.\nUrsa likes to sneak his first Rosh very early on in the game. It can be worth the effort to plant wards around the pits early on if he's lazy and doesn't smoke into Rosh."

        "guide": "Tips\nTake advantage of the proximity Greater Bashes you are gifted while Charging. If you're trying to land a stun on a unit that can't be targeted by Charge (if they're cycloned, debuff immune/BKB'd, banished, Linken's Sphere'd, etc) line yourself up so that you can cast Charge on a unit behind your intended target so you'll bash them en route.\nCharge is blocked by Linken's Sphere on cast. You can potentially outplay this by Charging a creep near where your target is farming and hoping the creeps die so the Charge target will shift to the hero. A substitute Charge will not pop Linken's.\nIf you see an opportunity to gank another lane, consider TPing to the nearest available structure before casting a cross-country Charge. The less time an enemy has to react and reposition, the more successful your ganks will be.\nIf you're getting ganked and you can't take the fight, immediately move your camera over to another lane, find a creep or neutral, and Charge it. This is your escape mechanism.\nMaintaining vision over Tormentors gives you an easy guaranteed Charge target if needed.\nYou can send your courier to give vision of neutral camps to sneakily Charge around the map.\nIn your buffs, there is a portrait of the hero you're Charging. You can alt+click this to announce to your team who you're targeting with Charge.\nDuring Charge, you are granted shared vision around the target. That means fog of war is removed around whatever the enemy hero can see. This is especially useful against heroes like Night Stalker who have extra vision in certain situations.\nIf you want to throw enemies off your Charge trajectory or slightly stall a Charge, consider backpacking move speed items while you're Charging. You'll slow yourself down and enemies may think you canceled the charge.\nYou can cast non-targeted items while you're Charging, like Phase Boots, Shadow Blade, Mask of Madness, Smoke of Deceit, BKB, and even Power Tread switching.\nYou can cast Bulldoze while Charging. Charge applies a Greater Bash on everything you hit and Greater Bash deals damage based off your move speed, so activating Bulldoze mid-Charge will boost your damage on contact.\nAfter your Charge connects on an enemy, you'll usually have enough time to fish for one Greater Bash right click in the stun duration before you need to chain into Nether Strike.\nGreater Bash's proc chance utilizes pseudo-random distribution (PRD). Statistically, about one in every six right clicks should be a Bash with 17%, but PRD encourages a lower likelihood of 'streaks.' If you go six right clicks with no Bash, chances are now much higher that your next right click will Bash thanks to PRD. Try to exploit this by priming right clicks on jungle or lane creeps before going for a gank.\nBasher/Abyssal passive bashes don't work with Spirit Breaker. The game won't allow you to have another bash besides Greater Bash.\nGreater Bash is essentially a crit dressed up in a scaling bash. Unfortunately, the only way of amplifying the 'crit' damage is by building move speed, not damage. The plus side is that you have two guaranteed ways of proccing this crit Bash with Charge and Nether Strike.\nYou can Nether Strike enemy couriers, but it won't damage them.\nProbably the best Dust carrier and anti-invis hero you could ask for in pubs. Every time Dust is off cooldown, Charge that Riki and bash him into next Tuesday.\nGet wards in the enemy jungle. Players will automatically avoid farming in lane once they realize you're becoming a threat and will start farming their jungle. Teach them that there is no sanctuary from the space cow.\nSB is one of the tankiest level 1 heroes in the game. Take advantage of your chuftiness and don't be afraid of getting into fights early on.\nMechanically, Agh's Shard Planar Pocket is like putting a Linken's Sphere buff on all your allies in an AoE around you. An enemy unit-targeted spell will do nothing to your ally and will instead get re-cast from the enemy onto you. If you're curious about the nuanced quirks and features of this spell, feel free to consult the wiki.\nAgh's Shard Planar Pocket will redirect channeled disables like Bane's Fiend's Grip, Shadow Shaman's Shackles, or Pudge's Dismember, but you'll only get disabled for a brief moment.\nCounters\nWard everywhere. You need to always be keeping tabs on Spirit Breaker: Where does he come from, where does he go, who is he ganking, Barathrum Joe.\nEven though most Spirit Breakers will carry Dust, consider getting a Glimmer Cape if he's Charging often. Nearly all of SB's damage is magical and needs to be dealt quickly, so the magic damage barrier while Glimmered can soak up a lot of his gank potential.\nCharge can break Linken's from across the map. In Herald scum pubs this makes Linken's a Spirit Breaker counter, but in RIAA-certified Double Immortal tier, this makes SB a Linken's counter.\nRemember that SB gets increased status resistance while in Bulldoze. Status resistance affects many things. It also doesn't affect a lot of things you may think it does. Here's the wiki page with all the interactions.\nOne of the easiest heroes to bait. No SB can resist Charging down a lonely Crystal Maiden quietly farming in lane, so take advantage of the mad cow's blood thirst. After a few failed ganks, the map will open up substantially when he stops Charging on a whim.\nRemember that while you're Charged, Spirit Breaker reveals the same fog of war that your hero sees. So don't just stand next to allies in plain sight if you're baiting him, make sure they're hiding behind trees where your hero wouldn't be able to naturally see them.\nSB can't cast Charge or Nether Strike when rooted/leashed.\nBulldoze can be removed off Spirit Breaker with basic dispels. This makes Eul's a handy item against him.\nShadow Demon can be a pretty strong counterpick with banishes to protect allies and Demonic Purge to slow SB and remove Bulldoze.\nYou can stun/root SB while he's Charging to cancel it. This is useful to know when you're getting Charged, but it's also useful when you're ganking SB. Keep a stun in your pocket for when he tries to Charge to another lane to escape.\nForce Staff, Harpoon, and other sources of forced movement can end Charge prematurely.\nForce Staff (or any other source of forced movement) will instantly remove Greater Bash's stun debuff. If an ally is stunned by Spirit Breaker's right click or Nether Strike, you can Force Staff them and they'll immediately be unstunned.\nThis tip will not work against Charge, however. Charge has its own built in stun mechanic, only stuns using Greater Bash's debuff can be taken off with forced movement.\nYou can disable SB while he's in the middle of the cast animation for Nether Strike to interrupt the animation.\nAgh's Shard Planar Pocket cannot be dispelled. Neither off Spirit Breaker himself nor his allies."

Consider using your courier to get vision of camps in fog to hit with Flak Cannon.\nHere's a very situational tip: Do you need to defend high ground but are afraid of getting close to the enemy? Or are you getting kited in team fights and just need to get your Flak attacks off? Consider planting a sentry ward and denying it with Flak Cannon on. It's a cheap and sneaky way to create a nearby primary target to Flak off of.\nEach Flak Cannon attack behaves like an independent right click in that they can miss from evasion, land from accuracy, or be reduced by damage block. However, Flak Cannon attacks will not carry item modifiers, only the primary target can be affected by things like crit or Maelstrom.\nAttacks from the Agh's Scepter Side Gunner, however, can proc item modifiers like lifesteal or Maelstrom.\nAgh's Scepter Side Gunner attacks an additional unit while the Flak Cannon buff is active.\nThe Side Gunner provided by Gyro's Agh's Scepter will prioritize the furthest enemy unit within its attack range.\nEach Call Down missile temporarily provides flying vision around its targeted AoE.\nCounters\nTaking on Gyrocopter 1v1 in the early or mid game is a bad idea.

Spray lowers armor significantly and Unstable Concoction deals physical damage.\nUnstable Concoction will affect the entire AoE, even when it detonates on you. If you're debuff immune/BKB'd, you won't be affected by the self-stun.\nYou can't target creeps with Unstable Concoction, but you can use the self-detonate AoE damage to farm stacked camps slightly faster, especially if you lay an Acid Spray down first.\nYou can use Unstable Concoction's self-detonate damage to deny yourself.\nBe aware that enemies can see the Concoction countdown timer.\nIf you're teleporting into a fight, consider casting Unstable Concoction before you start the TP. That way you'll have a pre-cooked stun ready the moment you show up. Only do this if you're the first person to TP to a building, though, otherwise you may end up stunning yourself before a delayed TP channel completes.\nYou get a lot of time between stacks on Greevil's Greed. If you're freefarming, you should be hitting the max cap constantly. If you're jungling, learn how to strategically draw aggro from neutral creeps using Acid Spray or any items you have to keep stacks up.\nYou can Greevil's Greed off Undying Tombstone zombies, Wraith King skeletons (both lives!), and any type of ward unit. You don't get Greevil's Greed from illusions or buildings.\nActivating Chemical Rage disjoints projectiles on cast.

Use it to wipe off things like DoTs, slows, blinds, or roots.\nGifting an Agh's Scepter also gives an ally all the stats that come with an Agh's Scepter and raises their net worth.\nIf you gift an Agh's Scepter to an ally that already has one, it will be immediately removed from their inventory and they will get all their gold back.\nIf you gift an Agh's Scepter to an ally that has an Agh's Blessing, it will also fully refund the price of an Agh's Blessing to that hero. This includes making gold out of a Roshan Agh's Blessing.\nCounters\nJust because you think the damage from Acid Spray isn't hurting you that much doesn't mean you should stand around in it. Acid Spray drops your armor substantially, so you're far more vulnerable to physical damage when in the Spray.\nAlchemist himself has pretty garbage armor, so armor-debuffing spells and items are great for killing him through Chemical Rage.\nUnstable Concoction explodes in a small AoE. Don't give your teammate a hug if they're about to get hit by the Concoction because it'll stun both of you.\nSimilarly, if you have Alchemist disabled mid-Concoction, stay away from the self-detonation. You'll also get stunned if you're standing too close to him.\nIf you silence Alchemist during Unstable Concoction, he won't be able to throw it until the silence ends.\nUnstable Concoction's projectile cannot be disjointed.\nYou can click on Alchemist to see how much time is left on the Chemical Rage buff.

        "name": "Invoker",
        "guide": "Tips\nRemember to change your orbs for their passive uses before casting a spell. A lot of Invokers keep their next spell Pre-Voked, but Quas orbs change the spell lifesteal, Wex orbs change the cooldown reduction, and Exort orbs change the spell amplification of each spell upon casting.\nCertain spells don't benefit from Quas/Exort orbs. You always want to have 3 Wexes active before casting Alacrity, Forge Spirits, or Ghost Walk.\nIllusions will copy whatever orbs your hero has when they spawn. The only orb configuration they'll benefit from are 3 Wex orbs for the move speed.\nCold Snap has ridiculous range. Use it to cancel consumable health regen on the enemy mid from a distance if you have vision of them.\nUrn of Shadows on an enemy can trigger a Cold Snap every second.\nPay attention to what your teammates are doing before you Tornado in a team fight. It's a great spell and all, but it also has Naga Sleep levels of ruining teammate spells.\nTornado serves as a basic dispel which allows you to remove most buffs off enemies including runes.\nYou can stack certain neutral camps with Tornado. This only works on some camps, however. The reason is because Tornado raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights. You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the -spawnneutrals command with cheats enabled) to see which camps work and which ones don't.\nTornado prevents targets from being attacked. This means towers can't aggro units that are being Tornado'd. You can leverage this to force the tower to swap aggro to a hero by Tornadoing a creep wave, but not the enemy hero in tower range.\nI remember Alacrity's spell combo because every time I cast it, it's time to lay the W-W-E Smackdown SHUT YOUR MOUTH.\nAlacrity can be cast on creeps, siege creeps, and summons (like Forged Spirits).\nForged Spirits are invaluable for pushing. They have amazing range late game, serve as two extra damaging and tanking units, can cut off the creep wave, and they last forever.\nForged Spirits are also great if you're mid to serve as rune control. Cast Forge Spirits around 20 seconds before the even minute mark and have it sit at the rune to kill it.\nGhost Walk is QQW. I remember this because every time I get ganked I want to QQ... W.\nGhost Walk HP/mana regen is disabled if you've taken player-controlled damage in the last 3 seconds.\nYou can cast Ghost Walk while channeling a TP. Just don't change your orbs or Invoke because that'll cancel a channel.\nDon't change your orbs in Ghost Walk. Pressing any hotkey will instantly dispel your invis. Ideally, you'll want to throw up 3 Wexes before you Ghost Walk, but you'll rarely be able to pull that off in a gank situation.\nIce Wall can be surprisingly effective in the mid lane matchup. If someone's making a move on your high ground and you're trying to shake them off, you can potentially get even more return damage by casting Ice Wall instead of Cold Snap.\nWith practice, you can lay Ice Wall perpendicularly to catch escaping enemies.\nThe disarm of Deafening Blast can only be bypassed by activating debuff immunity/BKB. If you hit an enemy with it, they can't take off the debuff even with a strong dispel like Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, they can ignore it by activating BKB. The knockback can't be dispelled by anything.\nSun Strike is useful for more than just sniping low HP heroes or comboing with Deafening Blast. Scoop a ranged creep last hit in the first creep wave or later in the game when you're just chilling regening in the fountain. Use the vision to scout out Rosh, runes, or jungle stacks.\nTormentors damage whatever hero hits them globally. If you're trying to escape enemies at critical HP, a big brain play could be denying yourself to a Tormentor by Sun Striking it.\nBlind Sun Strikes are always hype, but you can consider using your team's Scan to assist with the timing.\nSun Strike damage fully pierces debuff immunity/BKB.\nThe Cataclysm ability granted by Agh's Scepter can be cast when Sun Strike is doubled tapped. It puts Sun Strike on a longer cooldown and creates 2 visible Sun Strikes (the enemy can see them) within 175-250 range of each enemy hero.\nAgh's Scepter Cataclysm can be useful to locate enemy heroes in the late game, similar to how a Zeus would casually use Thundergod's Wrath for vision. This is highly relevant if you suspect the enemy team has Smoked.\nLearn and practice the stereotypical Invoker combos: EMP+Tornado, Forge Spirits+Cold Snap, Chaos Meteor+Sun Strike+Deafening Blast, Forge Spirits+Alacrity, Tornado+Sun Strike.\nDespite its appearance, Agh's Shard EMP is not classified as traditional \"forced movement,\" but rather a \"pull.\" This means it can't interrupt things Magnus's Skewer, Phoenix's Icarus Dive, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Spirit Breaker's Charge of Darkness, or a Techies Blast Off.\nCounters\nAlways keep tabs on the spells he has Invoked by clicking on him to get a better idea of how he's building. If you're mid and he has Sun Strike invoked, warn your team. If he's missing and he's been going Q/W, tell them to watch out for a Tornado from the trees.\nTry to remember he has Sun Strike BEFORE you think you narrowly escaped the first gank of the game, rather than after.\nHeals from items like Greaves, Mek, or Magic Wand are applied before Tornado damage takes place allowing you to survive potentially lethal Tornadoes. Casting Pipe's barrier may allow you to Blink out of a low-level Tornado when you land.\nForged Spirits burn off your armor with each of their attacks. Invoker isn't just harassing you just to be annoying. Well he is, but he's also trying to soften you up for any follow up right clicks.\nRemember that Sun Strike damage is split evenly among all targets hit. If you think an ally is about to die to Sun Strike, stand next to them to diffuse the damage.\nThis is especially relevant in the mid lane. If Invoker is trying to kill your range creep with Sun Strike, it's usually worth tanking some damage so he doesn't get the last hit.\nFor the love of everything, please bring some sort of detection (Dust or sentry wards) when trying to gank Invoker. Ghost Walk is not a good escape, dude needs several points in Wex just to not slow himself.\nFaceless Void's Time Dilation will calculate its debuff for all of Invoker's spells that are on cooldown, even if they aren't actively invoked."

Early game you want to spam it for nuke damage, late game you want to cast it on heroes who rely on spell combos (Invoker, Bristleback, Puck, etc). All game long you want to use it for the shared vision that the shower curtain provides on the targeted hero.\nLast Wording a target before Hurricane Piking them allows you to keep them in vision for your attacks.\nThe Last Word silence won't trigger on enemy channeled spells until their channel completes. So Last Wording a Pudge before he starts Dismembering won't silence him until he's done.\nAgh's Scepter Last Word's AoE can target units in fog, invisible targets, and even untargetable units like a Dark Willow in Shadow Realm or Slark in Shadow Dance.\nMuch like with Undying's Tombstone, you don't want to use Global Silence and then have the enemy team walk away until the spell wears off. Silencer's job is rarely to start fights, he's there to SILESILESILENCSILENCSILENCSILSILSSILSILENCE fights that are on the cusp of breaking out. You usually want to cast Global Silence soon after your initiator goes in or as soon as your team gets initiated on. It's okay to let a spell or two leak through at the beginning if it means that the enemy is committing to the fight. The goal is to hit them with the 4'33\" right when they're at the point-of-no-return in the team fight.\nYou can save Global Silence to break channeling ults as well (Enigma's Black Hole, Bane's Fiend's Grip, Witch Doctor's Death Ward, Crystal Maiden's Freezing Field), but often times it's better to stop them from using their spells altogether by preemptively silencing than to risk getting disabled while they're channeling.\nIf you're past the phase when huge 5v5 team fights are being decided by a single ultimate, save your ult until after BKBs get popped. If you Global Silence while an enemy is debuff immune/BKB'd, they'll get silenced. If you do it before they go debuff immune, they can dispel the silence by activating BKB.\nEnemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced. If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nHeroes that are hidden (Puck Phase Shift, Outworld Devourer Astral Imprisonment, Shadow Demon Disruption, other banishes) will not be affected by Global Silence. Global Silence will affect enemies that are invulnerable or cycloned, however, since they're still technically on the map.\nCounters\nAvoid trading kills with this hero because his permanent INT steal from Glaives adds up quickly.\nIf you begin channeling a spell while Last Word is on your hero, Last Word won't silence and damage your hero until the channel completes.\nFor Puck, Phase Shift can completely dodge the silence and damage on Last Word if you complete the channel. However, if you prematurely exit Phase Shift, Last Word will trigger normally on your hero.\nSave your BKB for after Global Silence is cast. If Global is cast while you're debuff immune/BKB'd, you'll still get silenced. If you go debuff immune after Global comes out, the silence is dispelled.\nEul's is a cheap, but effective, way of dispelling Global Silence. Lotus Orb, Manta Style, Disperser, Satanic, and Guardian Greaves are also basic dispels that can remove the silence.\nBecause Silencer takes your INT with Glaives, mana consumables are more effective. If you've got a few stacks of INT stolen, that's the best time to eat a Mango, use a Bottle, or activate a Stick."

This is important if you plan on Blinking out immediately from Astral to avoid a turn animation in the Blink direction.\nTry to Astral an enemy before casting Sanity's Eclipse on them to increase the mana difference between your heroes.\nSanity's Eclipse will damage enemies who are currently banished in Astral Imprisonment.\nHowever, the Mana Allergy debuff from Sanity's Eclipse will not be applied to enemies who are Astral'd.\nIf you Astral allies with Agh's Shard, they can walk out of spells like Faceless Void's Chronosphere, Enigma's Black Hole, Mars's Arena, and Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nA weird interaction to note is that Agh's Shard Astral Imprisonment is a double edged sword against Disruptor. While you do allow allies to walk through Kinetic Field, you will no longer be able to save them from Glimpse because they're no longer hidden/banished.\nSanity's Eclipse deals double damage to illusions.\nCounters\nPure damage immunity from BKB significantly cuts OD's damage output from Arcane Orb.\nOD can't cast Arcane Orb when he's silenced.\nConsider building mana/INT items like Skadi or Wind Waker when you're playing against OD to minimize the damage you'll take from Sanity's Eclipse.\nIf you have the Mana Allergy debuff from Sanity's Eclipse on your hero, spells will heal OD first before damaging him.\nHeals from items like Greaves, Mek, or Magic Wand are applied before Astral damage takes place allowing you to survive potentially lethal Imprisonments.\nEssence Flux can be disabled by Breaks.

Use them to scout, check/kill runes, block/stack camps, body block targets, and most importantly, follow around high priority targets.\nIf you want a Wolf to quietly hunt someone, select the Wolf, then issue a follow command by pressing the move command hotkey(default M)+left click on a target. Your Wolf will tail your target but never attack and break invisibility. However, be aware that when the duration of the Wolf ends, the enemy hero will suddenly see a Wolf keel over and die next to them, possibly compromising your sneakiness.\nWhen jungling or Roshing, you can shake neutral aggro off your Wolves the same way you can drop tower aggro. Select the Wolf in question and then attack hotkey+left click another allied unit and the creeps should start focusing another unit.\nHowl works on Rosh.\nDuring night time, the Howl debuff is global. Pay attention to the minimap to see if your team can benefit from you Howling enemies.\nLycan has 1800 night vision when in Shapeshift form.\nAgh's Scepter Wolf Biting an ally will turn them into a melee hero no matter what range bonus items or spells they have. If a Wolf Bitten ranged hero has a spell that issue secondary attacks, the attacks won't connect unless the additional targets are in melee range.\nCounters\nHowl can be dispelled off allies.\nIllusions of Lycan provide Feral Impulse. Useful to know if you're playing Terrorblade since Reflection can give you a big damage boost.\nWhile you can't slow him when he's Shapeshifted, mass Eul's Scepters are a great way to keep him on lockdown. It's cheap enough that most people on your team can build it and it buys time for other stuns to come off cooldown.\nEven though Lycan deals damage through many units, Crimson Guard isn't the most effective item against him due to Shapeshift's crits. However, he can't crit on buildings, so the active Guard on structures can be useful at slowing his push.\nWinter Wyvern's Winter's Curse can be irritating for Lycan to deal with since it turns him into food for all his summons.\nEnchantress's Agh's Scepter Little Friends can turn Lycan's army against him.\nWitch Doctor's Agh's Scepter Death Ward can bounce attacks on creeps/summons.\nNight Stalker's Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night allows NS to eat ancient creeps at night, including ones that may be dominated by a Helm of the Overlord."

        "name": "Brewmaster",
        "guide": "Tips\nYou always get the Brewed Up buff when casting Cinder Brew, your hero does not need to be in the target AoE.\nDealing any magic damage refreshes the duration on your own Cinder Brew Brewed Up buff. This includes damage from items, like Blood Grenade or Urn.\nKnow that critical attacks always roll during the beginning of an attack animation. You can't swap into Fire Brawler stance and get the crit mid-attack animation.\nHowever, slowing effects are applied on attack impact. So if you wanna get real sweaty, you can swap out of Fire Brawler after an attack starts and into Void Brawler to also get the slow on impact.\nAny auras that your hero has will be carried through to your primary Split Brewling. The primary Split Brewling order goes from Earth \u2192 Storm \u2192 Fire \u2192 Void as each one dies. The primary Split Brewling's location is also where your hero will return to when the ult ends.\nWith Agh's Shard, canceling Split early will bring your hero back to whichever the primary Split Brewling is.\nThe Earth Brewling's Demolish passive deals extra damage to structures.\nRemember that most buffs can be applied to your Brewlings. Invoker's Alacrity, Ogre Magi's Bloodlust, or Solar Crest can be great for pushing with the Earth Brewling.\nI don't care what the situation is, the Cyclone on the Storm Brewling will always be useful. Cyclone a support so that your teammates won't waste time killing that squishy Crystal Maiden when they should be focusing the carry. Cyclone that Omniknight so his whole team cries at him for not ulting. Cyclone that Phantom Assassin who is slicing everyone to shreds because the rest of her team is locking your allies down. Cyclone the roided up Sven and waste a bunch of his God's Strength duration. Then, when he comes back down, wait a few seconds for it to come off cooldown and Cyclone his punk ass again.\nThe Storm Brewling's Cyclone lasts extra long against \"non-hero\" creeps/summons. This isn't really useful for anything other than maybe annoying a Chen or keeping a dominated creep in place.\nThe Storm Brewling's Cyclone lasts the full duration even if Primal Split ends.\nBe aware that unlike Eul's Scepter, the Storm Brewling's Cyclone does not deal damage on landing. So heroes can potentially Blink Dagger out immediately after hitting the ground. Not even the Fire Brewling's Immolation aura will damage enemies quickly enough to cancel a Blink Dagger.\nCasting the Storm Brewling's Dispel Magic on the Cyclone will immediately cancel it. Don't stand around watching the enemy spin for the full Cyclone duration if your team is ready to kill them, just end it early.\nDispel Magic can also end an enemy self-Eul's.\nDispel Magic deals a ton of damage to summoned units in the AoE.\nThere are a few exceptions. The following units don't take damage from Dispel Magic: Lone Druid's Spirit Bear (other creep-heroes do take damage, only the Bear doesn't), clones (ex: Meepos, Arc Warden's Tempest Double), Undying's Tombstone zombies, and ward-type units (ex: Pugna's Nether Ward, Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards)\nHeroes with a lot of summons like Broodmother's Spiderlings, Enigma's Eidolons, Nature's Prophet's Treants, or Wraith King's Skeletons can also have their armies instagibbed by Dispel Magic.\nNeutral creeps do not count as summons. So dominated or Chen/Enchantress creeps won't take damage.\nIllusions do count as summons. Keep this mechanic in mind if you're against heroes like Naga Siren, Phantom Lancer, or Terrorblade. Dispel Magic even deals full damage to 'strong' illusions, like from Chaos Knight's Phantasm.\nDispel Magic is also, obviously, a weak/basic dispel. The dispel works on all enemies and allies in the AoE. So in addition to removing buffs off enemies, you can also remove things like silences, roots, or slows off your allies.\nThe Storm Brewling's Wind Walk gives free bonus damage on its next attack. You should easily be able to use it multiple times during your ult if you pay attention to the cooldown. It's a lot of physical damage that you may have been missing out on.\nAttacks during the fade time of the Wind Walk apply the bonus damage without losing the buff. So technically, you could get 4 Wind Walk damage hits in 2 Wind Walk casts. It's fairly easy to do, just make sure you're in range of the enemy you're attacking, cast the Wind Walk, and then immediately right click the enemy. The first attack will land with bonus damage without removing your invisibility.\nThe Wind Walk also gives a massive move speed increase on the Storm Brewling. Use it if you're trying to catch an escaping enemy. Once you catch up, cast the Cyclone.\nLate game, Wind Walk will be your main escape mechanism because your Fire Brewling will go down as soon as someone so much as farts on it, and the Earth Brewling goes down surprisingly quickly once carries start doling out big single target damage.\nMechanically, the Void Brewling Astral Pull follows the same rules as Force Staff.\nThis means it can be cast on rooted/leashed allies to save them, but can't Pull people out of things like Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Faceless Void's Chronosphere and the Pull gets cancelled by Nullifier.\nYou can use the Void Brewling Astral Pull on other Brewlings. Handy if you need to get your Storm Brewling into range for a Cyclone or to Pull the Earth Brewling out of a bad position before your ult ends.\nThe Void Brewling can self-cast Astral Pull. In most situations this is usually just a targeting nuisance, but you could use it send the Void Brewling itself on to a cliff during a team fight for vision.\nDon't forget, you can also use Astral Pull to cliff enemies. The Pull always goes the full distance, so make sure the enemy is max Pull range away from a cliff before casting it.\nOften times you'll be finishing your Primal Split only to have the entire enemy team staring hungrily at your Earth Brewling, waiting for your return. If you have a Blink Dagger, position your Earth Brewling where you can get an effective Blink, and start mashing the item hotkey. Just be sure to turn the Spirit to face the direction you want to Blink in before Primal Split ends. This will avoid any turn animation delay since Brewmaster faces the same direction that the Spirit was last facing.\nIn high ground siege situations, you can consider sacrificing your Earth Brewling into the enemy fountain after your Storm Brewling has already made a break for it to guarantee that you'll respawn in your Storm Brewling.\nBrewling attacks count the same as illusions when calculating damage against ward-type units that require a fixed number of attacks to kill (ex: Pugna's Nether Ward, Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards), which is usually half damage.\nIf you take any talent/spell point that 'upgrades' your Brewlings, you will have to resummon your Agh's Scepter Primal Companion for it to receive the updated stats.\nCounters\nKill the Fire Brewling ASAP in the early game. It's very squishy, but deals the majority of damage in Primal Split.\nUnlike Eul's Scepter's Cyclone, the Storm Brewling's Cyclone does not apply any damage when it ends, so you can immediately Blink out once you land.\nYou can left click the Spirits and check their buffs to see how much time is remaining on the Split. This is relevant if you're trying to drop some damage/disables on the Earth Brewling to disable Brewmaster's Blink as he returns. You can alt+click the buff to announce the time left in chat for your team.\nSILENSILSILSILESILENSILENCESILENCE. Dude hates silences and hexes. Primal Split has a cast time and hexes and some silences are instant. If you have these on your team he'll likely have to cut his Blink \u2192 Cinder Brew \u2192 Thunder Clap \u2192 Primal Split combo to just Blink \u2192 Primal Split.\nIt's worth taking the time to kill his Agh's Scepter Primal Companions if it's convenient. He can't resummon one for a long time if you successfully kill it."

        "name": "Shadow Demon",
        "guide": "Tips\nIf you select your Disruption illusions you can see how the enemy is skilling themselves since your illusions' skill points will mirror the enemy's.\nThere are pretty much only three reasons why you should ever Disrupt an ally to save them. Either you're trying to protect them from a few seconds of a disable they're in, you're helping them avoid damage until their Blink Dagger comes off cooldown, or they're about to die and you're using it like a Dazzle Shallow Grave. For slows, blinds, silences, or disarms, unless you're communicating with your allies, avoid Disrupting them. 9 times out of 10, people will get mad at you even if they were dead anyway.\nHowever, there are plenty of occasions to use Disruption on allies in other situations. During tower pushes, make more Lunas for maximum Glaives. During defenses, make fake Batriders and send one in. When warding, make more yous to bait a gank attempt.\nYou can cast Disruption on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies. You won't banish them, but you'll still generate illusions of them.\nYou can banish debuff immune allies with Disruption.\nDisseminate deals a separate instance of damage to all affected enemies. The damage will be the same type as the incoming damage, but it will be sourced to Shadow Demon.\nDisseminate works on all types on damage. Magical, physical, pure, right clicks, items, every source of incoming damage (except HP removal e.g. Soul Ring or Terrorblade's Sunder) can react with Disseminate.\nDisseminate even reacts on self damage. Like Pudge taking damage from his own Rot or Pugna taking damage when healing allies with Life Drain. Strangely, it does not react on Techies' Blast Off self-damage, though.\nDisseminate can target Rosh, but Rosh is immune to Disseminate damage. So it won't help your team take Rosh faster, but you could make the enemy team hurt themselves while they take Rosh.\nShadow Poison impact and detonate damage fully affects units in Disruption.\nDisruption banishes a target for 2.75 seconds. Blink Dagger's damage cooldown is 3 seconds. Cast a Shadow Poison while a target is Disrupted to keep their Blink Dagger on cooldown. You don't even need to use the Detonate because the impact damage from the Shadow Poison will disable Blink Dagger and then they'll immediately take damage from the illusions afterwards.\nShadow Poison can't be dispelled. This could be handy to identify heroes who can create illusions easily.\nShadow Poison is a great spell to use to stack camps because of its ludicrous range and cheap mana cost.\nWith practice, you can stack multiple camps at once (old map, but you get the idea). If you're crazy, you can use your Disruption illusions for even more stacking!\nStacking camps is useful with Shadow Demon because he's actually great at taking stacks himself with Shadow Poison. Once maxed, it takes ~6 stacks of Shadow Poison to kill any camp.\nShadow Poison is a great spell to draw creep aggro off a tower during defenses.\nShadow Poison's projectile gives flying vision as it travels.\nBe aware that enemies only get Stick charges if the caster of a spell is in vision. If you're spamming Shadow Poison against enemies with Sticks, try to cast while hiding in tree fog.\nDemonic Purge is a constant dispel that can go through debuff immunity/BKB. Here are a few choice applications of this rare interaction:\nSlow and dispel debuff immune enemies. That one's... obvious.\nTarget and bring down enemies who are cycloned from their own Eul's Scepter. Will also instantly cancel any self-Eul's the enemy casts while Demonically Purged.\nWill instantly dispel any movement from a Force Staff.\nInsta-dispel things that can save enemies like: Ghost Scepter, Glimmer Cape, Crimson Guard, Aeon Disk's Combo Breaker (the Combo Breaker hard dispel will still go off, but the no-damage grace period is dispellable).\nConstantly remove any dispellable buff abilities like Storm Spirit's Overload or Ursa's Overpower.\nDemonic Purge can be used to slow couriers, but won't damage them.\nAgh's Scepter upgraded Demonic Purge Breaks passive abilities.\nCounters\nBecause Disruption illusions spawn one \"tick\" after the real hero emerges from the banish, you can attack+move the ground right underneath the Disruption before it ends and you'll always start attacking the real hero (assuming no other targets are closer to draw your attack+move aggro).\nDisseminate can be dispelled, but Shadow Poison can't.\nGet a Magic Stick if he's spamming Shadow Poison. Just remember that you only get stick charges on spells cast in a 1200 radius if the enemy is in vision.\nThe only reason Shadow Poison is balanced is because the projectile is very easy to dodge. Don't get lazy. You won't see a fat 4 above your head, but you can look in your status bar debuffs to see how many stacks are on you. If you've bumbled your way into 3 stacks, it's probably time to start backing off.\nEven though Demonic Purge will instantly cancel a Eul's cyclone, you'll still get the basic dispel from casting the Eul's."

        "name": "Lone Druid",
        "guide": "Tips\nDon't be afraid of letting your Spirit Bear wander away from you. Use it to draw aggro from an incoming creep wave, stack jungle camps, go shopping for you, go back to the fountain to heal, play checkers with Death Prophet, or just scout for you.\nIf your Spirit Bear just died and you're on the losing end of a team fight, don't just cast it again in the hopes that you can turn the fight around. Save it for when you respawn.\nYou and your team can deny the Spirit Bear to avoid giving its bounty to the enemy. You won't take any Backlash damage if you do.\nWhen you level up the Spirit Bear, it basically creates a fresh Bear unit on the spot. You can strategically time when you level up the Bear to take advantage of this.\nAll the Bear's cooldowns are refreshed when it's leveled up. This can allow you to potentially double Entangle a target. Get a root with the Bear, the root is now on cooldown, level up the Bear, no more cooldown on root.\nLeveling up the Bear also resets Savage Roar's cooldown on the Bear. You can use this to double Roar enemies or you can cast Roar for free from the Bear because the Bear also gets full mana when leveled up.\nLeveling up the Bear also resets its resummon damage cooldown timer, allowing you to immediately resummon it when you level it up.\nAmusingly, resummoning the Bear does not reset cooldowns. Only HP and mana are reset on a resummoned Bear, but a leveled Bear gets fresh cooldowns and mana but not HP.\nLeveling up the Bear effectively 'kills' the old Bear and replaces it with a brand new unit. This means any buffs/debuffs that were on the old Bear will be gone and any projectiles traveling to the old Bear will be disjointed. So if your Bear gets stunned or Razor Static Linked, you can level it up to instantly remove those debuffs. Be aware that buffs, like from runes, will also be removed when the Bear is leveled up.\nBizarrely, resummoning the Spirit Bear does not count as a 'death' dispel. Buffs/debuffs will remain as if it was the same old Bear.\nWhenever you Return the Bear, it always appears on the top-right of your hero, regardless of what direction you're facing.\nIf you die and the Spirit Bear has Agh's Scepter, Returning the Bear will bring it to your dead body's location.\nAgh's Scepter Spirit Link on your hero can be cast on creep-heroes like Warlock's Golem or Visage's Familiars.\nMechanically, think of the Spirit Bear like a 6th hero on your team. Any buffs/debuffs that would last differently on creeps versus heroes last the hero duration on the Spirit Bear. For the most part, interactions will behave similarly to clones like Arc Warden's Tempest Double or Meepos.\nSpells that create illusions will fully work on the Bear.\nWard units that require a certain number 'hero attacks' to kill will not treat the Bear like a hero, but instead a creep. Like Phoenix's Supernova or Pugna's Nether Ward.\nGlobal team spells like Chen's Hand of God, Centaur Warrunner's Stampede, or Mirana's Moonlight Shadow will work on the Bear. Spells like an enemy Zeus's Thundergod's Wrath will also hit the Bear.\nSome examples of spells that can't target the Spirit Bear: Legion Commander's Duel, Bounty Hunter's Track, Rubick's Spell Steal, Morphling's Morph, Terrorblade's Sunder, Weaver's Agh's Scepter Time Lapse.\nSpells that grant enemies temporary buffs usually work on the Bear. Like Monkey King's Jingu Mastery stacks, Outworld Destroyer's Astral Imprisonment mana steal, Slark's Essence Shift temporary stat steal, and Silencer's Glaive temporary INT steal.\nMars's Spear and Slark's Pounce treat the Spirit Bear like a creep, not a hero.\nMost spells that grant enemies permanent buffs on kills will not proc on the Bear. Like Axe's Culling Blade, Lion's Finger of Death, and Necrophos's Reaper's Scythe.\nThe Spirit Bear can activate and use every type of rune except for Wisdom runes (the Bear can't gain experience).\nThe Spirit Bear can channel Lotus Pools, but not Watchers or Outposts.\nAn enemy's Smoke of Deceit will not break if they get close to the Spirit Bear. However, a Smoked Bear behaves the same as a hero when approaching enemies. Mmmmm, Smoked Bear.\nSavage Roar gives you a guaranteed channel breaker. If someone's TPing in front of you, don't pray for an Entangle, just cast Savage Roar to cancel it.\nSavage Roar prevents the enemy from doing anything during its duration because fears are effectively a silence and a mute combined. This includes stopping enemies from activating BKB, Abaddon casting Borrowed Time, or Ursa casting Agh's Scepter Enrage.\nSavage Roar won't move heroes who are Entangled.\nEntangling Claws's proc chance utilizes pseudo-random distribution (PRD). Statistically, about one in every five right clicks should be a root with 20%, but PRD encourages a lower likelihood of 'streaks.' If your Bear goes five attacks with no root, chances are now much higher that the Bear's next attack will root thanks to PRD. Try to exploit this by priming right clicks on jungle or lane creeps before going for a kill attempt.\nAt max level, Savage Roar's fear should buy you enough time to complete a TP to escape from a gank.\nThe Spirit Bear can use TP scrolls/Boots of Travel. It's always worth keeping a scroll on your Bear. In lane, let the Bear go back to base to heal, then use it as a courier and Return it back. In the mid/late game, it's another way to get it to escape if the Return channel gets canceled.\nKeeping a TP scroll on the Bear also allows it to travel to other lanes easily. Teammate getting ganked under the tower but you're busy farming? Let the Bear teleport over, Savage Roar the enemies away, then Return back to you.\nThe Spirit Bear can consume Moon Shard.\nAgh's Shard Spirit Bear Fetch roots targeted heroes, but doesn't disarm them. Enemies and allies can both still attack while being Fetched.\nAgh's Shard Spirit Bear Fetch shares priority with Batrider's Lasso. Whichever spell comes after will override the previous one.\nThere are some other mechanic similarities between Fetch and Lasso. If you apply a fear (like Savage Roar) to a target that's getting Agh's Shard Fetched, it'll end the Fetch (same as Lasso).\nCounters\nMost spells treat the Spirit Bear like a hero/clone as opposed to a creep. Read the tips above for a more detailed list on how certain spells interact with the Bear.\nBully the Bear in the first few minutes of the laning phase. The Spirit Bear gets tankier as it levels up. Don't worry about harassing the hero, just try to whittle down the Bear.\nIf you see that the Spirit Bear suddenly has full HP in lane, it's a great time to kill Lone Druid since he probably just spawned a fresh one. If you manage to get him Bearless in lane, you just murdered his early game.\nKilling the Spirit Bear will net you a pretty hefty gold and experience bounty. If you know the Druid is definitely going to die, try killing the Bear first before finishing off the hero.\nThe easiest way to kill the Spirit Bear in the mid/late game is with minus armor. Desolator and Assault Cuirass are worthwhile items to consider against Lone Druid.\nApplying Break on the Spirit Bear disables the Demolish passive that gives the Bear increased magic resistance and bonus tower damage.\nSmoke of Deceit doesn't break if you get close to the Spirit Bear.\nPhantom Assassin's Blur doesn't break either. She can even attack the Spirit Bear while Blurred.\nIf Lone Druid is pushing your tower, try to save the Glyph for when he triggers True Form.\nSavage Roar and other fears can be dispelled off allies with basic dispels, like from Lotus Orb."

        "guide": "Tips\nIf you land a close range stun, it may be worth saving Reality Rift to gap-close after the stun wears off if you don't need the armor debuff.\nReality Rift does not break enemy channels.\nIf you cast Reality Rift on a debuff immune/BKB'd enemy, you'll just get teleported straight to them instead of meeting in the middle.\nReality Rift grabs any illusions you own within a 1375 radius.\nThis includes Rifting in illusions of allies created with Agh's Scepter Phantasm.\nThis is fairly common knowledge, but please turn on your Armlet before you Phantasm. Congratulations, you got super beefy illusions with no HP drain. This is also true pre-Manta or pre-Illusion rune for any hero.\nRemember to turn on Armlet before picking up Shield runes too.\nYou can toggle your Armlet while TPing.\nYou can start in INT Treads and swap while in the Phantasm delay to get your illusions to spawn with AGI treads. You can't get them to STR because INT -> STR is two ticks, which can't be performed in time.\nYou can use the split animation on Phantasm to dispel your hero, disjoint projectiles, and banish yourself for 0.5s.\nAgh's Scepter Phantasm will globally dispel allies, but will not disjoint projectiles or banish them.\nIf you're about to die, take a risk and send one of your illusions where you wanted to go while you sit still. Most people will assume you have garbage micro and continue pursuing whichever one is moving.\nLike with Manta Style, re-casting Phantasm from a Refresher will replace the old illusions, not create an additional set of illusions.\nI don't often recommend starting items, but CK is an excellent Mango carrier.\nCounters\nReality Rift and Chaos Bolt have amusingly long cast times. If you're getting chased by CK, use tree fog liberally to juke his spells.\nCK cannot Reality Rift when rooted/leashed.\nWinter Wyvern can be an annoying hero for CK to deal with. Cold Embrace makes it nigh impossible for him to kill targets and Winter's Curse can turn his own Phantasm illusions against himself.\nPhantasm illusions are considered 'strong' illusions and cannot be instagibbed by things like Lion's Mana Drain, hexes, or Dagon.\nHeroes with spells that are useful even against 'strong' illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.\nEnchantress is a notable CK counter since Untouchable makes her very difficult to kill early by CK alone and she can easily steal Phantasm illusions with Enchant.\nBecause Phantasm illusions spawn one \"tick\" after the real CK emerges from the banish, you can attack+move the ground right underneath the Phantasm before it ends and you'll always start attacking the real CK (assuming no other targets are closer to draw your attack+move aggro).\nThis tip also works against heroes generating Manta Style illusions. Attack+move a target before they Manta and you'll start attacking the real hero one tick before Manta illusions spawn.\nGhost Scepter can buy you valuable seconds if CK Rifts you in to his illusion orgy."

        "name": "Meepo",
        "guide": "Tips\nEarthbind can root and reveal invisible targets.\nThe Earthbind projectile provides flying vision in a small radius as it travels.\nEarthbinding an enemy unit provides shared vision over that target (you see what the rooted unit can see). This works on enemy heroes and creeps, but shared vision is not provided when rooting neutrals.\nThe \"Earthbind Grants True Strike on Targets\" talent isn't just for Meepo, it also gives teammates true strike on targets affected by Earthbind.\nThe \"Earthbind Grants True Strike on Targets\" talent works against debuff immune/BKB'd enemies. They won't be rooted, but you'll still get true strike for as long as the debuff is on them.\nThe only reason your whole entourage should be in the fountain is if you just respawned, otherwise there should always be at least one Meepo out on the map. If they all need heals, just rotate them in and keep one somewhere safe in the jungle.\nYou can Poof to illusions of your hero that are owned by you or your team.\nPoof deals damage at the starting and ending locations of a Meepo. If they Poof onto themselves, both damage instances happen around the unit.\nYou can cast Eul's Scepter (don't need Wind Waker) on any of your Meepos.\nEvery Meepo can pick up and use runes.\nOnly the primary Meepo benefits from Moon Shard attack speed.\nIf the primary Meepo dies to a neutral, you have to wait the full neutral death penalty time. If a clone dies to a neutral or Rosh, there is no added penalty and your death time is calculated off your level.\nConsider enabling the console command dota_player_smart_multiunit_cast true if you're playing Meepo or Arc Warden. This command makes the game attempt to cast a targeted spell on the first unit that doesn't have the spell on cooldown without you tabbing through control groups.\nHere's an example: You have your hero and your other Meepos all selected. You cast Earthbind from your hero and put the spell on cooldown. You can press the spell hotkey again and the game will attempt to cast the spell, skip your hero because it's on cooldown, and then make the next Meepo cast Earthbind. It'll continue skipping any Meepos who have the spell on cooldown until it finds a valid one.\nIf you need to get to a place quickly on the map from the fountain, you can theoretically buy Boots of Travel, use them from a clone, and then sell them from your hero for the full price. It turns the gold unreliable, but could be handy in certain situations.\nWhile secondary Meepos are capable of gaining experience, they gain a reduced percentage. If you can keep your main hero around when units die, you'll level up faster.\nAny buffs/debuffs that were on secondary Meepos before you MegaMeepo'd will continue, but they'll be invulnerable and untargetable as long as they're standing on your head.\nAny buffs/debuffs applied to your Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo will continue on to your primary Meepo once the spell times out.\nIf you pick up a shield rune while in MegaMeepo, you get to keep the gigantic barrier on your primary Meepo.\nDropping/backpacking Agh's Scepter will immediately end MegaMeepo. You can use this as an eject button if you don't want to wait for the spell to time out.\nYou can even backpack Agh's Scepter while MegaMeepo is stunned or banished or under some other debuff and your secondary Meepos will immediately be free to act while your primary Meepo continues the debuff.\nAgh's Scepter MegaMeepo can't save Meepos that are in Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Legion Commander's Duel. You can save them from spells like Batrider's Lasso, Doom's Doom, Necrophos's Reaper's Scythe, and Primal Beast's Pulverize.\nYou can also save Meepos from Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse, but I'm pretty sure it's unintended. If you Poof into your Cursed crew and shift+queue MegaMeepo, you'll make a frozen tower of Meepos and walk away from the Curse.\nThis also works against Disruptor's Static Field.\nUpon ending Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo, your secondary Meepos will continue performing the last action you gave them before you went MegaMeepoMode. So be prepared for them to run in some dumb directions once the MegaMeepo falls apart.\nCounters\nEarthbind has a massive cast animation and travel time, so it's fairly easy to juke. Meepos have to predict your path almost a whole second in advance, so just change your trajectory to avoid the net.\nMeepos find success when they can isolate a dying Meepo and free them from the fight. A way to counter that is with heavy lock down for a single Meepo so it can't Poof out or by using silences, roots/leashes, or multi-instance stuns (like Clockwerk's Battery Assault, Enigma's Malefice, Invoker's Cold Snap, or Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask).\nAll you really need against Meepo is to have a ton of single target damage to kill one Meepo. You don't get extra credit for dealing damage to his every Meepo. You only need to kill one.\nMeepo struggles to deal with Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse. Technically, if you don't catch the primary Meepo he can pull some Agh's Scepter MegaMeepo shenanigans to get out, but only the godliest Meepos know about that tech that is literally one scroll up on this screen.\nEach Meepo counts as an individual hero when calculating Pangolier's Shield Crash buff.\nPretty much all of Grimstroke's spells aside from Phantom's Embrace are amazing against Meepo.\nElder Titan gets a ton of buffs for running over a bunch of Meepos with his Spirit.\nMeepo can't cast Agh's Shard Dig while rooted/leashed.\nIndividual Meepos can be Tracked by Bounty Hunter and when one dies you get gold for each one Tracked.\nShiva's Guard can be pretty value versus a Meepo with the attack/move speed slow, AoE damage, and HP regen reduction."

Try to stay in trees or on your Grasp vines as much as possible to preserve the free pathing.\nIf you have Agh's Shard, you will maintain Nature's Guise invisibility even while using spells or items.\nUse Leech Seed on a frontline enemy creep to heal your own creeps when pushing.\nLeech Seed will continue pulsing heals even after the target dies.\nLeech Seed works on fogged and invisible units. You can use the particle effects of the heals to track the debuffed target.\nThe tracking goes both ways, however. Be wary of enemies following the Leech Seed particles to your location when you're hiding in trees.\nYou can cast Living Armor on buildings to heal them.\nYou can cast Living Armor on creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, Warlock's Golem, or Brewmaster's Primal Split Brewlings.\nYou can cast Living Armor through the minimap or by clicking on the portraits at the top of the screen. You can hold ALT to see all your allies current HP under their top bar portraits.\nFun Fact: You can even see teammate buyback status in the top bar by holding ALT. If they have a gold border at the bottom of their HP/mana, they can buyback.\nSince everyone knows to not BKB/Manta until Overgrowth comes out, you have to play a dangerous game of chicken with enemy carries. Most of the time you'll just have to bite the bullet and let the carry break out and dispel themselves in a team fight and hope disabling the other enemies is sufficient.\nOvergrowth is a rare type of root that can also cancel enemy channeled spells. It even cancels channels through debuff immunity/BKB.\nOvergrowth won't connect on invisible targets, but it will provide true sight on all rooted targets for its duration.\nYou can place Agh's Scepter Eyes in the Forest on Iron Branch trees. This can potentially be useful for high ground defenses or sieges where trees are hard to come by.\nWhile holding Agh's Scepter, all trees on the map will respawn 10 seconds after they're killed.\nNow for the more forbidden tech. Whenever you pick up Agh's Scepter on Treant, all trees on the map instantly respawn. Read: Whenever you pick up Agh's Scepter. This means you can just constantly drop/backpack your Agh's Scepter and put it back in your inventory for immediate tree respawns. This even works while you're dead.\nTrees can only respawn if there's nothing standing on top of where they would respawn. If there's a unit blocking their spawn point, they won't regrow until the unit moves.\nYour Eyes in the Forest will stop giving vision while you don't have Agh's in your active inventory, but they won't disappear.\nCounters\nLiving Armor makes dives against a team with Treant a huge gambit with the survivability the spell provides, so be careful with early game aggression.\nThere's no such thing as chipping down a tower against a Treant thanks to Living Armor's heal. You have to fully commit to every tower push, otherwise you're just wasting your time. There's nothing Treant players love more than seeing a solo hero waste time whittling a tower down by 10% and there's nothing they hate more than seeing five heroes wrecking ball towers from a 100 to 0.\nActivate BKB or Manta Style or Lotus Orb or Guardian Greaves or Disperser or Satanic or any other dispel after you're Overgrowth'd to break out of it.\nIn lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. Treant Protector is much more annoying when he's able to weave in and out of a treeline, so just deforest the entire lane and you'll have a much easier time.\nThe \"Light Collector\" neutral item's active can destroy trees in an AoE around you which can help you find a Treant Protector hiding with Nature's Guise.\nIf Treant has an Agh's Scepter, you should really carry a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury to chop down the Eyes.

        "name": "Undying",
        "guide": "Tips\nDecay is a weird nuke. You take STR and deal the nuke damage on a hero on every cast, but it doesn't feel like much because their HP bar still looks close to full. After you play Undy for a couple of games, you realize that enemies will often fail to notice how much HP they're missing in lane and how much damage you've built up. So crank the aggression.\nDecay deals double the nuke damage to creeps.\nIn lane, try to use Decay only when you can catch multiple heroes. Even if the enemies you're laning against are trying to avoid one another, they'll eventually bumble into each other at some point. That's when you pounce.\nTry to use healing items only when you don't have Decay stacks on. Since Decay gives you more STR, you're healing a lower percentage of actual health when you eat a Tango.\nSoul Rip is technically more useful as a heal than a nuke because healing isn't reduced by magic resistance.\nIf you're getting ganked, use Soul Rip before spamming Decay. Decay increases your STR, but Soul Rip only heals a flat amount of HP. You'll heal a larger portion of your max HP if you use Soul Rip first and then steal strength.\nSoul Rip searches for units around Undying to calculate the heal, not units around the target. Units in fog don't add to the count.\nYou can Soul Rip your Tombstone to heal it.\nTombstone Zombies add to Soul Rip's unit count.\nZombies disable backdoor protection on tier 2 towers for some reason. You can aggro neutral creeps towards towers to force zombies to spawn in the 900 backdoor protection AoE if there are no lane creeps around.\nFun fact: This is also true of the \"Trusty Shovel\" neutral item Kobold. Little guy disables tier 2 backdoor protection all by himself.\n\"Oh good, Flesh Golem is down, let's force a fight,\" said no team ever. Tombstone is your real ult, so use it carefully. The fight needs to get nice and committed before you should feel comfortable bringing the thriller, so avoid initiating with it.\nCasting Tombstone in chases can be useful if you need vision since the Tombstone has 1200 day/night vision and the zombies have 1400 day/night vision for some reason.\nTombstone zombies won't spawn on targets that are in fog, but existing zombies will continue following any targets that escape into fog.\nTombstone is great for taking Rosh since Rosh will draw aggro on your zombies.\nWisdom rune fights are often decided in milliseconds. You can try to mess with an enemy's right clicks by placing a Tombstone on top of the Wisdom rune spawn point to potentially help win the click war.\nYou can deny your Tombstone to avoid feeding the gold bounty. Remind allies that they can also deny the Tombstone.\nTry to place your Tombstone in awkward spots enemies can't easily find in the middle of a fight. Like on cliffs or other nearby high ground areas. You can't hide it in trees very easily since the Tombstone will destroy trees in a small radius when placed.\nUnlike many other banish saves, there are no restrictions to Agh's Shard Tombstone's bunker targeting. You can freely bunker allies affected by Faceless Void's Chronosphere, Enigma's Black Hole, Batrider's Lasso, or Legion Commander's Duel.\nFlesh Golem raises your HP when cast thanks to the STR bonus, so you may consider using it when escaping if the extra HP will help you survive a gank.\nEach of your attacks in Flesh Golem will apply a slow and damage amplification Plague debuff on an enemy. Try to punch all the high value targets once to apply the debuff, it lasts for a while.\nThe Flesh Golem Plague damage amp debuff fully works on Roshan. However, it doesn't work on Tormentors because, unlike magic amp and armor reduction, barriers ignore generic damage amp.\nDebuffing an enemy with the Flesh Golem Plague damage amplification allows your team to damage targets through spells that usually provide 100% damage reduction like Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse.\nFlesh Golem illusions do not apply the Plague debuff.\nA Tombstone will spawn from the \"Tombstone On Death\" talent when dying normally or dying under Aegis.\nCounters\nAvoid standing next to your lane partner when you're against Undying. If he's spamming Decay, make sure he's only hitting one hero.\nBecause Undying takes your STR in lane, healing items are more effective. If you've got a few stacks of Decay on yourself, that's the best time to use a Tango or Salve.\nDawnbreaker's Starbreaker, Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon, Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist, Pangolier's Swashbuckle, Mars's God's Rebuke, Luna's Moon Glaives (and active Agh's Shard Moon Glaives), Hoodwink's Acorn Shot, Void Spirit's Astral Step, and Medusa's Split Shot are spells capable of committing mass zombie extinction.\nLuna is especially strong against Undying since she can directly attack the Tombstone and all the Glaives will bounce around to nearby zombies.\nAxe can Counter Helix off zombie attacks, but it won't kill zombies.\nAlchemist gets Greevil's Greed gold off zombie kills even though they have a 0 bounty.\nKill the Tombstone. Finish it. I don't want this toss-one-attack-I-didn't-do-much-damage-to-it-so-it's-not-my-problem or this well-we-almost-killed-it-but-then-it-got-Soul-Ripped-so-whatevs garbage. Unless your team has one of the aforementioned methods of zombie genocide it is almost ALWAYS worth killing the Tombstone the second it comes up. Even if you're faring okay as the carry, your support players are fending for dear life if you don't help them.\nSnapfire's Lil' Shredder is great at quickly taking down the Tombstone.\nIllusions deal \u00bc the damage a hero does to the Tombstone.\nPhantom Lancer can Juxtapose off the Tombstone.\nMjollnir is a fairly good pickup against Undying since zombies constantly hitting you will help Static Shield proc more frequently. The lightning(s) won't kill zombies, though.\nCrimson Guard's active effectively neutralizes all zombie damage.\nZombies will lose interest in you and die if you go invisible.\nYou can see how much time is left on the Tombstone by clicking on it and watching its 'Spell Immunity' buff run down."

        "name": "Rubick",
        "guide": "Tips\nTelekinesis is a damn good disable mainly because Rubick has essentially non-existent cast times. For the most part, Telekinesis can be pulled off just as quickly as a hex. So if you're worried an initiator is about to Blink in and start a team fight, keep spam casting and canceling it on their initiator so that once they Blink in range, you'll instantly pick them up.\nTelekinesis being instant allows you to steal spells that good players will usually avoid letting you get. If an Earthshaker just threw out a casual Fissure, they'll almost always cover it with Enchant Totem. However, if you pluck them out of the air with an instant Telekinesis disable, you can steal their spell before they get the chance to cast another.\nRubick has to be facing the direction that you want to cast Telekinesis Land, so if you're trying to run away after grabbing someone, cast the Land immediately after picking an enemy up, otherwise you'll have to turn around again to target the Land.\nGenerally, you want to cast the Land as soon as possible anyway so that your allies can see where you're dropping the enemy and can plan accordingly.\nYou can continue changing the Telekinesis Land location until the spell goes off.\nAgh's Shard Telekinesis will make allies land as soon as you target Telekinesis Land rather than waiting the full duration. This also means you can't change the Land location after you cast it.\nIf a Telekinesed enemy gets affected by any items/spells that apply forced movement, they'll immediately drop straight down and stun the area underneath.\nWhen a Telekinesed unit dies, it also immediately drops down and stuns the AoE. You can pick up a weak creep and Fade Bolt it to death to instantly get an AoE Telekinsis stun.\nIf you're getting chased by multiple heroes, it can be smart to cast the Land towards you, rather than away from you. During the Lift's duration, the other enemies will have probably passed your target up, so the Land should stun them on the way back.\nAgh's Shard Telekinesis allows you to throw allies out of things like an enemy Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Slark's Pounce leash.\nYou cannot Telekinesis allies out of Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Legion Commander's Duel, so don't even bother. It'll put the spell on cooldown and do nothing if you try.\nOne of the hallmarks of a strong anti-pusher is the ability to draw aggro from a creep wave off of a tower during pushes. Fade Bolt is probably one of the strongest spells in the game to do this, mainly because of its zero cast time, huge range, damage reduction ability, and substantial nuke damage. When you want to slow down the enemy's push, cast it on the creep wave and the creeps will lose interest in hammering your tower and come for you instead.\nFade Bolt bounces always take the shortest possible distance when jumping from target to target.\nFade Bolt will not bounce to enemies that aren't in vision. If you're Fade Bolting a creep wave at night time you'll only zap the creeps you see.\nFade Bolt loses damage with each bounce, so you should generally target the ranged creep first when trying to clear waves so you can actually get the last hit with full damage.\nArcane Supremacy cast range bonuses also apply to Rubick's items.\nSpell Steal's debuff amplification is basically the opposite of status resistance in terms of mechanics.\nYou can Spell Steal through debuff immunity. Just because Enigma is a big golden teardrop doesn't mean you can't steal Black Hole through BKB.\nPatience is a virtue. Don't steal spells all willy nilly. Go into a team fight knowing the spells that you would want to steal and wait for them to be cast. You'll only be able to steal ~2 spells per team fight, so make them count.\nDifferent spells are useful at different stages of the game. Sure, most ultimates are almost always worth keeping, but other spells that help Rubick farm or scout can prove valuable during downtime.\nRubick has minimal cast times on any stolen spells. Forget everything you know about landing Leshrac's Split Earth, be amazed at how you can ejaculate an Earthshaker Fissure in a split second, and revel in how much better a spell Zeus's Lightning Bolt is when you don't have to fist pump for half a second to cast it.\nBuffs/spells/summons lingering after a Spell Steal times out or if you Steal another Spell all follow different rules. You'll just have to play a bunch of Rubick to find out what works and what doesn't.\nMorph's Attribute Shift is a rare example of a spell that lasts not only after Spell Steal times out, but after death. Even after many deaths.\nStolen spell cooldowns are persistent on Rubick. If a Spell Steal is about to time out and you're sad you never got to use your stolen Tidehunter Ravage, don't just cast it for giggles. You may end up screwing yourself over in a future team fight if you steal it again.\nThere is a slight delay as a stolen spell \"projectile\" travels to your hero. You can use this window to get one last cast of your previously stolen spell, like an invisibility spell, before the new one arrives.\nYou can globally check if an enemy hero is an illusion or not by attempting to cast Spell Steal on them. If you clicked on an illusion, you'll immediately get an error even if you're not in cast range.\nYou can't Spell Steal Morphling's Morph or Tinker's Rearm. Balance reasons? Or because it would simply cause too many programming headaches.\nHowever, you can Spell Steal from a Morphling who is in a Morph. You could theoretically duplicate one of your teammates spells this way.\nAny stolen spells that have Agh's Scepter upgrades will automatically be upgraded if you have an Agh's Scepter.\nAny stolen spells that have Agh's Shard upgrades will automatically be upgraded if you have an Agh's Shard.\nWhile Agh's Scepter allows you steal two spells, if you steal a spell that takes two slots, you'll still lose your previously stolen spell.\nYou can use Earth Spirit's own Stone Remnants with your stolen versions of his spells.\nWith Agh's Shard, you can cast a stolen Life Drain into an enemy Pugna's Nether Ward.\nCounters\nRubick being in your lane automatically adds another ~375 distance that you need to keep in your safety zone because of Telekinesis's repositioning ability. Don't let him into your zone.\nRemember that Rubick has much better cast range on your abilities than you do thanks to Arcane Supremacy.\nRubick is all about capitalizing on your forgetfulness/laziness. \"Oh right, they have a Rubick, I should have cast Anchor Smash after Ravage. I should have cast Bulwark after Arena. I should have cast Sticky Napalm after Flaming Lasso.\" Put a condom on all of your spells, it's 99% effective.\nAlways check what spell Rubick has stolen by clicking on him. If you're Pudge and Rubick just Ghostbuster'd your essence, there is a big difference in how the next minute is going to go down if he stole Rot or if he stole Meat Hook."

        "guide": "Tips\nIf you ground target Agh's Shard Thunder Strike, you can bypass enemy Linken's Spheres and Lotus Orbs.\nIf you ground target Agh's Shard Thunder Strike from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nIf a unit inside Kinetic Field is being hit by Thunder Strike, all units in the Kinetic Field will take Thunder Strike damage.\nCount down your Glimpses. Glimpse is an incredibly powerful spell, but only if used intelligently. Glimpse will always revert someone to where they were 4 seconds prior. So as soon as you see someone out of position, remember where they were and start counting to four. Watch where the end location dot is and cast a Field around it.\nOne method to timing Glimpses is by casting a Thunder Strike on your target. The third Strike connects four seconds after the spell was cast. Plus, Thunder Strike gives you vision of your target.\nGlimpse will break any enemy channels on cast.\nGlimpse instantly kills illusions, but not 'strong' illusions.\nTry getting wards/vision behind towers when pushing. Players will often TP to the rear of a tower and linger there for >4 seconds so they don't get insta-Glimpsed. Spot them and send then from whence they came.\nKinetic Field provides vision inside the circle, allowing you to scout Rosh, trees, or high ground from long range. This is also useful for dewarding cliffs.\nOnly the inside of Kinetic Field provides vision. The areas near the wall do not provide vision. If an enemy is pushing up against the Kinetic Field wall, you won't be able to see them.\nThe outside of Kinetic Field is just as useful as the inside. Don't be afraid to block someone on the outside with the edge rather than lock them in.\nAllies with spells that apply forced movement, like Drow Ranger's Gust, Mars's Spear, or Windranger's Agh's Shard Gale Force, can potentially push enemies out of your Kinetic Field.\nAgh's Scepter Static Storm 'mutes' enemies which prevents usage of any item, including TP. Mutes even cancel TPs that are mid-channel.\nAgh's Scepter Static Storm can mute enemies who are invulnerable/cycloned. However, heroes who are hidden/banished will not be muted and they will be able to activate items/spells upon emerging from the banish.\nCounters\nTP behind trees or even one tier back if you're defending a push against Disruptor unless you like wasting gold and getting sent back to base by Glimpse. Glimpse will also be a real pain if you're Dawnbreaker (Solar Guardian), Io (Relocate), Nature's Prophet (Teleportation), Spectre (Shadow Step), or Tinker.\nPay attention to the AoE of the Static Storm. Often times Disruptors will cast half of it within the Kinetic Field and the other half outside. Stop running against the wall of the Field and sitting in the Storm if you don't have to.\nKinetic Field provides vision in the middle of the Field, but not actually around the wall. If you're trying to escape in trees and you see a Field forming, you're actually the least visible if you touch the wall.\nMany spells that provide forced movement can allow a hero to move through a Field.\nSome forced movement does not let you pass through Kinetic Field. Force Staff/Hurricane Pike/Harpoon are the main examples, but the following spells also don't get you out of Kinetic Field: Dawnbreaker's Starbreaker, Magnus's Skewer, Mirana's Leap, Monkey King's Tree Dance or Primal Spring, Phoenix's Sun Ray, Primal Beast's Onslaught, Slark's Pounce, and Snapfire's Firesnap Cookie don't work.\nSpirit Breaker's Charge makes literally no sense. Sometimes it goes Kinetic Field, sometimes he gets stuck on the edge. I can find literally no consistency whatsoever on the rules the cow follows.\nSpells that provide flying movement or unobstructed movement do not allow a hero to pass through Kinetic Field.\nPlanting an Iron Branch can let you escape a Kinetic Field. To perform this trick, get your hero to push against the edge of the Field, then either portrait cast Branch or cast the Branch behind your hero, but inside your hero's white selection circle. The resulting tree may shove you out of the Field. This trick also works against Slark's Pounce leash.\nThe reason Iron Branch can push you out of a Kinetic Field is because the tree has collision. That means spells that create collision, like Tusk's Ice Shards, Nature's Prophet's Sprout, or a well angled Earthshaker Fissure, can also push a hero out.\nOther repositioning effects can also provide a Kinetic Field escape. Like getting kicked by an Earth Spirit Boulder Smash, getting Meat Hooked by Pudge, or even a lucky Manta Style rearrangement.\nEarth Spirit can also Rolling Boulder in/out of a Kinetic Field and can Agh's Shard Geomagnetic Grip allies out.\nWind Waker movement can get you out of a Kinetic Field.\nDebuff immunity or banishes are the only ways to \"dodge\" Glimpses. Eul's Scepter doesn't work (cyclone ends early) and most forced movement spells get canceled by Glimpse.\nBanishes that can dodge Glimpse include: Lifestealer's Infest, Outworld Destroyer's Astral Imprisonment, Puck's Phase Shift, Shadow Demon's Disruption, Snapfire's Agh's Scepter Gobble Up, and Tusk's Snowball.\nManta Style is another very important banish that works against Glimpse. It's tricky, but with enough practice, you should be able to fairly consistently dodge Glimpse with a Manta Style activation.\nCertain un-interruptable position changing spells like Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist and Activate Fire Remnant, Phantom Lancer's Doppelganger, Riki's Tricks of the Trade, Sand King's Burrowstrike, Timbersaw's Timber Chain (if the Chain hasn't connected before Glimpse goes off), Void Spirit's Dissimilate, and Necrophos's Agh's Shard Death Seeker can also dodge Glimpse relocation.\nAn extremely well timed Harpoon on a target could buy you some space when being Glimpsed. You need to time it so the Harpoon projectile is flying to the target when the Glimpse ends and you'll get yanked slightly in the target's direction after it lands.\nA Pipe can save you from the Glimpse+Static Storm combo if you have a Blink Dagger. Putting up the Barrier will eat the Glimpse damage and first few instances of Static Storm damage, potentially buying you enough time to Blink out.\nKunkka is a sleeper counterpick to Disruptor since you can X Marks an ally who's getting Glimpsed to save them from being repositioned.\nIf Disruptor is spamming Thunder Strike on you in lane, consider standing next to your ranged creep to make it take damage and bring it into deny range."

        "name": "Nyx Assassin",
        "guide": "Tips\nNyx gets the luxury of easy positioning thanks to Vendetta to make multi hero Impales simpler. Vendetta one hero and then roughly target the Impale on another hero. Since you're in such close range to your first target, you will most likely nyx them both with the Impale.\nYou can stack certain neutral camps with Impale. This only works on some camps, however. The reason is because Impale raises the creeps above the spawn box check height, but different camps have different heights. You'll have to test it in a lobby yourself (use the -spawnneutrals command with cheats enabled) to see which camps work and which ones don't. The timing is extremely close, you have to nyx the spell at ~59s.\nIf you see an enemy with a Lotus Orb on, you can activate Spiked Carapace and then cast Mind Flare on them. They'll reflect the Mind Flare and then instantly get stunned by the Carapace because they damaged you. This also works against Anti-Mage's Counterspell active. Remote nyxing.\nSpiked Carapace blocks an entire damage instance, so Blink Dagger and regen won't be broken if the Carapace reflects the damage source. Nyx.\nIf you're playing against a Bloodseeker and you get Ruptured when you have Blink Dagger, you can activate Spiked Carapace and Blink so the entire ~1200 range Rupture damage instance nyxes onto BS.\nSpiked Carapace will instantly come out after banishes and stun enemies from damage sources like Eul's cyclone or Outworld Destroyer's Astral Imprisonment.\nYou can cast Spiked Carapace while in Vendetta and the invis won't be removed. Try to Nyx yourself into enemy AoE spells while in Vendetta to get an easy setup for your combo. This is especially useful when playing against enemies who finish off creep waves with spells like Lina with Dragon Slave or Puck with Illusory Orb.\nOther less obvious sources of damage can also be handy to Carapace yournyx into, like heroes with cleave or Radiance or Ember Spirit's Flame Guard, Batrider's Firefly trail, Centaur Warrunner's Retaliate, or even Templar Assassin's Psi Blades since they hit invisible units.\nSpells that use ward units to deal damage will not interact with Carapace. For example, Witch Doctor's Death Ward is considered an independent damage source, so walking into a Death Ward with Carapace on will not stun or damage Witch Doctor.\nVendetta's damage is great in the early/mid game, but you're better off using the invisibility to get good Impale positioning in the late game. Enemies will have BKBs and be grouped up late game, making it a lot harder to fully nyx someone without them reacting. Don't get greedy with Vendetta attacks if you don't need the damage, just go straight for the Impale while you're invisible.\nYou can nyx yourself into Vendetta while you're channeling a TP (like all other invis spells).\nBe on the map as little as possible. The less time you spend nyxing around in lane, the less willing the enemies are to farm if they don't know where you are.\nVendetta is a great spell to eighty-nyx couriers with. Try setting up observer wards to catch courier paths so you can snipe them.\nCounters\nBe aware of your damage sources. Nyx can Carapace stun you off of things like Radiance burn or any DoT you put on him. You can toggle Radiance while TPing.\nBe wary of using Lotus Orbs when against Nyx. He can target you with Mind Flare and have Carapace pre-casted to stun you when you least expect it.\nResist the urge to retaliate whenever he blows his full combo on you. Nyxes almost always Carapace as soon as they finish their sequence. Just walk away. Be the bigger person. Don't stun/kill yourself.\nTry to bait out Carapace by casting and canceling spells with long and obvious animations or even canceling attack animations.\nKeep your eyes on the scoreboard in the first 10 minutes of the game to see when Nyx hits level 6. Most Nyxes will leave the map as soon as they have access to Vendetta, so get some sentries ready."

You can use this banishment period to avoid ground targeted spells.\nYou can start in INT Treads and swap while in the Mirror Image delay to get your illusions to spawn with AGI treads.\nIllusions benefit from the \"Safety Bubble\" neutral item's barrier.\nIllusions are not affected by backpack delay, so you don't need to wait the full cooldown to spawn them with a swapped backpack item.\nUnified move commands (look in your options to find out what the key modifier is, by default it's CTRL) may allow you to micro your illusions a little easier.\nIf you really want to step up your micro, consider incorporating 'cloning' into your skill repertoire.\nUse Mirror Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes throughout the game.\nWhen defending high ground, send your illusions out one by one rather than as a group. Enemies can use AoE spells to take out every illusion in one fell swoop if you send them as a clump. Better yet, don't even let a single illusion stand around and fight the creep wave, just let it keep slithering down the lane while maintaining creep aggro. Force enemies to chase the Image before it shepherds their creep wave all the way back to the river.\nEnsnare provides true sight on an enemy if they go invis while netted.\nEnsnare can target enemies who are invulnerable, such targets slept by Song of the Siren.\nInvulnerability also applies to other things, like being able to Ensnare enemies who are cycloned or spells that provide invulnerability like a Storm Spirit in Ball Lightning.\nWhen chasing a fast enemy with an illusion, consider using a move command on the target as opposed to attacking the target. It'll stick closer to your victim since it won't waste time in attack animations and you can build up Rip Tide stacks with your hero elsewhere on the map.\nDon't forget you can cancel Song of the Siren on demand by pressing the spell hotkey again.\nRubick can't steal Song of the Siren from the End subspell. He can only steal it if you don't cast any other spells after starting Song.\nUnless you're partied up in a 5 stack, you should probably stick to only using Song of the Siren defensively. There's a strong possibility your team will just rage at you even if a few of their spells whiff and it was their fault.\nSupposing you do have a group of teammates who can take advantage of Song, here are some useful synergies:\nDark Seer - Vacuum can reposition sleeping units.\nDisruptor - Place a Static Storm on enemies to silence them. With Agh's Scepter Static Storm, they'll even be muted immediately after waking up and won't be able to pop BKB.\nRazor - Song doesn't stop Static Link (but he can't cast a new Static Link on sleeping targets).\nUndying - Zombies continue to spawn on sleeping enemies.\nWarlock - Channel a fat Upheaval slow during the Song.\nWeaver - Swarm bugs can latch on sleeping units, but won't reduce armor.\nYou can apply Veil of Discord's Magic Weakness active to slept units. However, Shiva's Guard's active won't work because the debuff is connected to the damaging component of the active.\nIf an enemy activated a BKB in a team fight and there aren't any huge allied spells being thrown out, you can try to isolate them with Song. Sleep the rest of the team and kill the debuff immune enemy.\nEnemy structures are invulnerable during Song, but allied structures aren't.\nIf you're TPing in to save teammates during a dive, consider starting the Song before you begin channeling your TP.\nThere aren't many situations in which you want to use every second of your Song. If you catch someone out with it, cancel it as soon as teammates are in position rather than buying the enemy team even more time to save them or letting the enemy hero get their cooldowns back.\nRoshan is deaf and Song does not affect him. Sing near Rosh to quickly steal the kill+Aegis from the enemy, or to allow you to finish Rosh without the enemy team causing a ruckus in the pit.\nComboing Song into Meteor Hammer is easier than you'd think. Don't bother timing it manually, just use shift queueing. Activate Song, cast Meteor Hammer, and shift+queue Song End while Hammer is channeling.\nCounters\nBecause Mirror Image illusions spawn one \"tick\" after the real Naga emerges from the banish, you can attack+move the ground right underneath the Mirror Image before it ends and you'll always start attacking the real Naga (assuming no other targets are closer to draw your attack+move aggro).\nThis tip also works against heroes generating Manta Style illusions. Attack+move a target before they Manta and you'll start attacking the real hero one tick before Manta illusions spawn.\nBe wary of activating any sort of debuff immunity (like from BKB) before Naga uses Song, otherwise Naga may just sleep all your teammates while you're fighting debuff immune alone.\nEnsnare is dispellable. This makes items like Guardian Greaves, Satanic, Disperser, Eul's, Lotus Orb, or Manta Style useful to have.\nAny level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Pugna's Life Drain, Pudge's Meat Hook, Lion's Mana Drain, Disruptor's Glimpse, Dazzle's Agh's Shard Poison Touch, and any Hex.\nOther heroes with spells that are useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.\nRemember when you kill Naga's illusions, you're slowing down her farm twofold since she'll also be getting fewer Rip Tide procs."

        "name": "Keeper of the Light",
        "guide": "Tips\nStop channeling Illuminate in the middle of the lane. Keeper works best as a creepy voyeur hiding in the trees gently stroking his staff, waiting to explode.\nDon't be afraid to terminate an Illuminate early if people are moving away. The horses have a travel time and a small amount of assured damage can sometimes be better than a huge amount of unreliable damage.\nLearn where the creeps should be according to what the time is to get the most out of Illuminate. The easiest way to do this is to look at the mirror lane on your side of the map and see where those creeps are.\nDon't randomly channel Illuminate when pushing into tier 3 towers just because it's off cooldown. Start it at X:28/X:58 to kill the upcoming creep wave.\nPay attention to the buff timer on Spirit Form. If you were charging an Illuminate up, it'll cancel whenever Spirit Form times out.\nBlinding Light doesn't stop enemy channels. It only applies forced movement, it's not a disable.\nIf a hero is chasing you in melee range, cast Blinding Light in front of yourself, instead of behind. Keeper will have to turn around to cast it if you target it behind you and the turn rate could be deadly.\nIf you're trying to maximize your Chakra usage, try to get as few INT/mana items on a hero before you Chakra them. Same concept as Tread switching.\nChakra Magic's cooldown reduction does not reduce the cooldowns of ultimates, only basic spells.\nChakra Magic's cooldown reduction works on passives, such as Kunkka's Tidebringer or Doom's Infernal Blade.\nChakra Magic's cooldown reduction works on charge based abilities, such as Earth Spirit's Stone Remnants or Broodmother's Spin Web.\nWhile Chakra Magic can't reduce the cooldown of ultimates, it can reduce the cooldown of spells granted by ultimates/shards/scepters, like your Agh's Scepter Will-O-Wisp or Zeus's Nimbus for example.\nIf you take the \"2 Solar Bind Charges\" talent, be aware that multiple Solar Bind casts on the same target don't stack, but instead refresh the debuff. This can be useful to maintain the full slow on an enemy by recasting another Bind before the first one times out.\nIf you take the \"Solar Bind Stun when target is fully slowed\" talent, be aware that each target can only be stunned once per Solar Bind debuff. You can't use a second Solar Bind charge on a stunned target to immediately stun them again.\nWhen trying to teleport a teammate in danger with Recall, keep in mind that if they receive any damage from a hero, the teleport gets canceled. Wait for your ally to run into the trees or just escape fog before casting the spell on them.\nAgh's Shard Recall will apply Chakra Magic to your hero and your Recalled target once the Recall successfully completes.\nWill-O-Wisp destroys trees in a massive AoE. Use this to counter Nature's Prophet's Sprout, burn down a bunch of trees during a chase, or stun a Tree Dancing Monkey King.\nThe first Will-O-Wisp pulse happens one second after the spell is cast.\nUnlike most other ward units, Agh's Scepter Will-O-Wisp does not take damage from towers.\nIt doesn't even take damage from the fountain. Not that you would ever abuse this information, right?\nCounters\nKeep your lane warded up tight if you're against KotL to keep eyes on when and where he's Illuminating.\nDon't underestimate Blinding Light. If you rely on right click attacks in fights, you may need a BKB or Manta Style or Satanic or Disperser just to dispel the miss chance on this spell.\nIf you think your team will have trouble pushing high ground against KotL, consider building a Pipe for the magic damage barrier.\nYou can select the Agh's Scepter Will-O-Wisp Ignis Fatuus and alt+click the buff timer to see how many seconds are left.\nClones like Meepo and Arc Warden's Tempest Double count as heroes when attacking the Agh's Scepter Will-O-Wisp. Illusions do not count."

        "name": "Io",
        "guide": "Tips\nThis is as much of a guide to playing with Io as it is actually playing Io. It's nearly impossible to Wisp properly if your teammates have no idea how the hero works. Actually, just teammate singular. Io only really needs one competent core-playing teammate to be effective.\nIf Io is over 700 units away from a Tether target, it'll move in until it's 300 units away from the target. The reason this is important is that when you see an allied Io trying to escape and they can't find any allied creeps to link, get close to them, but not too close. Once Io has you Tethered you can start moving away.\nIo can start channeling a TP while flying to a Tether target.\nWhen traveling to a Tether target, Io breaks trees in a small radius around where it lands. Use this to create easier jungle paths or to break trees for sight.\nTether DPS works on creeps. Try to arrange your heroes in a way that the line is damaging neutrals or lane creeps when free farming.\nTether DPS also works on Rosh. It's especially worthwhile to keep Rosh in the Tether AoE since Tether also significantly slows enemy attack speeds.\nTether+Overcharge can be used to buff non-hero units. Amusing targets include Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Warlock's Golem, Beastmaster's Boar, and siege creeps.\nIo copies the move speed of the Tethered target. This means teammates should generally apply move speed buffs to the Tethered target, not Io.\nDagon's active instakills any non-ancient creep. Dagon also heals the caster for a percentage of the damage dealt, which, for an instakill, is equal to the current HP of the creep. It's a corny strategy, but you could theoretically Dagon full HP creeps to provide a burst heal to your Tethered ally.\nYou want to cast Spirits ~15 seconds before Relocating so that you can cast them again mid-gank.\nActivate Spirits in the fountain before TPing out. The Spirits last for a while, so it's basically a free cast.\nWith Agh's Scepter, you can manually explode your Spirits by pressing the spell hotkey. Useful for quick burst damage when farming creeps.\nYou can toggle Spirits Movement while channeling a TP.\nTether and Spirits can hit invisible heroes.\nWhile scouring the map/minimap for a destination to Relocate to, right click your Tethered ally. Assuming you have the \"Right Click Allies to Follow/Deny (not Attack)\" option enabled, right clicking an ally makes your hero follow that ally around so you don't encounter the awkward, \"Alright this guy? Okay we're Reloc--WAIT WHAT THE HELL WHERE ARE YOU? WHY DID YOU GO TO FARM ANCIENTS? I SAID WE WERE RELOOHHHH NNNNNOOOOO.\"\nPay attention to the timer on Relocate and ask your teammate for consent before taking them back.\nYou can double-tap Relocate to automatically target the fountain.\nWhen trying to Relocate save an ally that you're not currently Tethered to, save the Tether for the last possible second before the Relocate goes off. The advantages of delaying the Tether are your Relocate-out position will be further from the fight and there is less possibility of you getting disabled during the Relocate cast which would cancel it.\nRelocate provides a small radius of flying vision around the cast location during the delay.\nAllied Banishes, cyclones, and Bane's Nightmare or Winter Wyvern's Cold Embrace can prevent Relocate from going off after being cast. I guess you could use this for some sick BKB baiting in the late game? Or maybe checking the Rosh pit without going into it?\nAn allied Snapfire's Agh's Scepter Gobble Up can even save Io from a Relocate return which differs from other similar Banishes.\nShadow Amulet's invisibility won't break when returning back from a Relocate. You don't need to do anything fancy like try to time the return during the fade time, you just need to make sure you hit your 'stop' hotkey at some point while invisible, otherwise Io will start auto attacking the nearest enemy upon returning.\nThe \"Attack Tethered Ally's Target\" talent will make Io attack any unit that gets hit with whatever is considered a 'right click' from the ally. This means Io will attack all enemies hit by Medusa's Split Shot, Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon and Agh's Scepter Side Gunner, Pangolier's Swashbuckle, and all other targets of instant attacks.\nCounters\nTethering heroes is unnatural I tell you hwat. Many people suggest killing Io first in engagements and that's all well and good, but a good Io will bait you into awful positions when attempting to kill the medic. The next best thing is forcing Io to separate from his ally and break the Tether. Remember that two different people are playing these heroes, so force them to separate.\nIf you disable Io while it's flying towards a Tethered target, you'll cancel the movement from Tether and keep Io in place.\nSpirits don't provide vision as they circle, but they will provide vision if they explode on a hero.\nKeep a close eye on your minimap when playing against an Io. If Relocate is cast, you'll see a bright red TP icon on your minimap at the destination.\nJust look at the clock, man. I see so many players try to freestyle Relocation return punishes. Do you have a Rosh timer method? Press that as soon as you see the red TP circle effect disappear. Then count to 12.\nStunning/rooting/leashing/banishing/hexing/cycloning Io during the pre-cast of Relocate will prevent the spell from going off. This is one of the main reasons why Wisps always Tether their ally at the last possible moment when trying to Relocate evacuate them from a fight. If you're focusing an enemy and you see Wisp eyeballing your target, try to save a disable to intercept the Relocate.\nApplying a fear/silence on Io can also prevent Relocate from going off, but only if the disabling debuff is on Io when the actual teleport is supposed to trigger.\nTaunts are the only type of disable that does not prevent Relocate from going off at any point of the Relocate cast.\nYou can also Eul's cyclone the enemy hero that Io is trying to save. Io can't target cycloned units with Tether, so you can outplay an Io who's trying to go for a last second Tether+Relocate save with this. Your team may get mad at you for Eul'sing an enemy who may have been stunned, but explain your reasoning after you win the fight and they'll realize you're actually a genius.\nRemember that Io gets a small radius of flying vision around a Relocate destination, so if you drop a Chronosphere or something in advance, Io may just break the Tether and travel alone.\nSpells that take advantage of enemies in close quarters can be effective against Relocates like Jakiro's Ice Path, Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse, Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, or Lich's Chain Frost.\nKunkka's X Marks can help prevent an enemy from getting Relocated out of a fight.\nUrn and Spirit Vessel are invaluable against Io lineups. Urn can be placed on Io to cancel any consumable regen. Spirit Vessel can be placed directly on the Tether target to reduce the amount of HP received from Io. Skadi and Shiva's also reduce HP regen.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing."

        "name": "Visage",
        "guide": "Tips\nYou can Grave Chill any enemy or neutral unit. If you see the enemy coming to gank you, just Chill the nearest creep and make a break for it. If you and your Familiars are trying to catch up to an enemy, Chill a neutral in the jungle to get in range quicker.\nFamiliars need to be within 900 range of your hero to benefit from the Grave Chill cast and Gravekeeper's Cloak bonuses.\nWhen leveling up your Familiars, they have to be re-summoned to get the new stats. Existing Familiars won't dynamically update.\nResummoning Familiars automatically refreshes their Stone Form cooldowns.\nCasting Stone Form from your hero won't give Magic Stick charges to enemies, but casting it from a Familiar does.\nThere are many other ways to use Familiars other than just for keeping you company. Use Brooklyn and Lexington to stack ancients, send them to gank a different lane, snipe some quick tower damage if your lane creeps have disabled backdoor protection, or put them behind a lane and use them to distract the next creep wave before a dive.\nWith clever positioning, you can just straight up cut creep waves without creeps being able to fight back.\nMost supports have a tough time dealing with your Familiars, so in team fights you can try sending them straight on the squishiest enemy to quickly force them out of a fight rather than immediately converging on the enemy carry.\nFamiliars deal physical damage which make them pair well with minus armor.\nIt's often worthwhile to keep a ward on the cliff between the enemy's secret shop and fountain. If you spot an enemy courier making its way over, you can try sending your Familiars to snipe it while it's shopping.\nYou can try hiding your Familiars near the back of the Rosh pit to get vision whenever Rosh respawns or to keep track of how quickly an enemy is killing Rosh.\nLike all invis spells, you can cast Agh's Scepter Silent as the Grave while you're channeling a TP.\nCounters\nYou can't see the countdown, but you can select a Familiar and see how much time is left on the Stone Form buff timer so you can prepare to kill it.\nFamiliars have terrible vision. Don't immediately get scared if you see them floating around. It's possible they have no idea where you are when there aren't any enemy heroes or wards nearby to be their eyes.\nBe aware that Scan will turn red on Familiars (and all other creep-heroes).\nCrimson Guard is an all-purpose-stop-touching-me-Visage item since damage block works on Familiars.\nBrewmaster's Storm Brewling can deal significant damage to Familiars with Dispel Magic dealing damage to summons. Try burn off Visage's Gravekeeper's Cloak damage resistance stacks first.\nWinter Wyvern can be irritating for Visage to deal with. Cold Embrace nullifies all damage from his Familiars and Winter's Cursing Visage next to his Familiars could be fatal."

        "name": "Slark",
        "guide": "Tips\nDark Pact is a 'nuke' like Lifestealer's Infest can be a 'nuke.' Yes, the spell can deal healthy damage, but that's not its only purpose. Don't yank the Pact ripcord the second you get in melee range of your gank target. Wait for them to turn around, or for their teammate to come in to save them, then pull the trigger and wipe off any potential disable. If you need to use Dark Pact for damage, only use it if you're sure the enemy can't stop you or try to save it for the killing blow.\nDark Pact can't remove a lot of things despite being a strong dispel. A few ones worth remembering are Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Bloodseeker's Rupture, Invoker's Deafening Blast, Witch Doctor's Maledict, Razor's Static Link, Ursa's Fury Swipes, Viper's Viper Strike, or Heaven's Halberd disarm. If you want to get rid of these spells, too bad.\nEach tick of Dark Pact strong dispels Slark.\nPounce won't latch illusions, making it useful for identifying the real Chaos Knight/Phantom Lancer/Naga Siren.\nPounce can hit and leash invisible units, but it won't give any vision of them.\nPounce connects with debuff immune/BKB'd targets and provides the Essence Shift stacks on collision. The leash won't restrict movement on debuff immune enemies, however.\nLeashing enemies with Pounce will cancel their TPs and prevent them from TPing while leashed. Mechanically, leashes function the same as roots.\nEnemies getting Force Staffed immediately ends your Pounce leash. While Nullifier does dispel Force Staff movement, it still won't stop Force Staff from ending Pounce leash early, so don't get Nullifier if you're expecting it to stop people from breaking your leash.\nTake advantage of your free pathing state in Pounce when you're escaping. Don't just leap along down the lane, jump over a tree line or clear a cliff to create a gap.\nOrienting Pounces to go where you want them to can sometimes be challenging when the game's pathing doesn't cooperate. A handy console command to work around this is:\n\n      cl_dota_alt_unit_movetodirection true\n\nThis command makes it so that whenever you're holding down ALT, your hero ignores pathing and tries to move in a straight line towards where you right clicked. You can also enable the \"Directional Move\" hotkey in the settings, but this ALT modifier may be easier to use once you get used to it.\nThis console command can also be helpful for aiming spells when escaping over cliffs like Mirana's Leap, Pangolier's Shield Crash, Ursa's Earthshock, or Zeus's Heavenly Jump.\nCapitalize on Essence Shift stacks. Take a tower or TP to another lane and use all the damage you have to continue snowballing. Don't just sit around and farm, the enemy should be scared of how much damage you have after winning a fight.\nYou will lose all Essence Shift stacks on death, including deaths from Aegis. The enemies will still be missing their stats for the full duration, however.\nYou need to be within 300 range of a target dying with the Essence Shift debuff to get the permanent AGI. Or if you get the kill credit, the enemy can be at any range.\nShadow Dance is an extremely effective spell for counterwarding. The moment you stop dripping and slow down, you're in enemy vision and the Shadow Dance passive buff is lost off your status bar.\nSo carry your own sentry wards. I'm serious. Yes, I know you're a carry, you've probably never clicked on the item in your life, but do it. Did you know observer wards give gold when you kill them? It's a net profit, I promise.\nAgh's Shard Depth Shroud's health regen fully stacks with Shadow Dance's health regen. If you desperately need HP and are willing to burn both cooldowns, cast Shroud on top of yourself while you're Shadow Danced.\nEnemies can still see the TP particle effect when you start channeling under Shadow Dance.\nSlark is one of few heroes that has 1800 night vision.\nYou can't cast Shadow Dance while channeling a TP unlike other invis spells, but you can use Shadow Blade or Shadow Amulet mid-channel.\nCounters\nDark Pact dispels as often as it damages, meaning that there are 10 little mini-strong-dispels throughout the duration of the spell. So don't bother trying to stun Slark mid-Pact, just wait for the spell to end.\nEven strong dispels, like from Dark Pact, can't remove Halberd's disarm.\nIf Slark Pounces on you, don't just immediately mash your stuns on him. Bad Slarks usually pop Dark Pact the moment they jump on someone because most enemies panic and use their disables as soon as this fishy boy starts stabbing them. Instead, accept the fact that you got caught, gamble that a Dark Pact is about to come out, then use your stun after you see Pact used. You may still die, but you might force him to use Shadow Dance to stay safe.\nIf you're playing against a smart Slark, you can go one layer deeper and cast and cancel your stun spell animation to bait out the Dark Pact.\nGround targeted spells (especially ground targeted stuns like Lina's Light Strike Array, Leshrac's Split Earth, Nyx's Impale, etc) are highly valuable against Slark for hassling him whenever he activates Shadow Dance.\nInexperienced Slarks have a tendency of going for long-range Pounces which are fairly easy to juke. Line yourself up with him when you're getting chased to tease the Pounce out, then move straight left or right and dodge it.\nIf you manage to move your hero outside the edge of the Pounce leash, it'll break. That means weird things that provide collision, like planting an Iron Branch or getting shoved by an Earthshaker Fissure or Tusk Ice Shards will break the leash. So do other repositioning spells, like getting kicked by an Earth Spirit Boulder Smash, getting Meat Hooked by Pudge, or even a lucky Manta Style rearrangement.\nIf you go for the Manta Style method, your best bet is to activate Phase Boots before Mirror Image to reduce your chances of collision with an illusion pushing you back into the leash.\nIf you go for the Branch planting method, either portrait casting or casting the Branch inside your hero's selection circle between your hero model and the leash is surprisingly reliable at breaking out of a Pounce. This Branch trick also works against Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nYou can Force Staff/Hurricane Pike out of Slark's Pounce leash.\nForce Staff will remove Pounce leash even if the target has a Nullifier debuff on them.\nHarpoon utilizes a lot of Force Staff's code. As a result, you can Harpoon out of Slark's Pounce. I say 'out of,' but really, you just need to cast Harpoon on anything, including Slark himself, and it'll instantly end the leash. You don't need to 'break' the leash with distance to end it.\nDebuff immunity/BKB allows you to walk out of Slark's Pounce leash.\nIf Slark is trying to escape, attempt to intercept his Pounce out by standing in front of him so he'll hit your hero instead of making a getaway over a cliff.\nSlark cannot Pounce when rooted or leashed.\nEssence Shift is the long con. You may think you're winning these exchanges in lane because Slark has awful HP, but he's gaining a Slipper of Agility and you're losing an Iron Branch's worth of stats every time you trade hits.\nYou'll get your Essence Shifted stats back when you respawn, but Slark will still have them as well. This is true for Aegis respawns as well.\nBreaks prevent Slark from gaining new Essence Shift stacks.\nGhost Scepter can help supports survive Slark ganks.\nBloodseeker notably counters the dickens out of Slark. Slark doesn't like to be silenced, he can't Dark Pact off Rupture, and if he loses too much HP he'll make BS Thirsty and give him global true sight, thus preventing Shadow Dance regen.\nSpirit Breaker is irritating for Slark to deal with since Dark Pact can't dispel Charge and since Charge will provide vision the whole time, Slark can't regen unless he activates Shadow Dance.\nSlark can't dispel Disruptor's Glimpse, making Glimpse into Static Storm+Kinetic Field often lethal.\nNaga's Song turns off Slark's Shadow Dance active and reveals him, thus stopping Slark from regening and being invisible. The Dance will continue once the Song ends, though.\nGleipnir can root Slark even when he's untargetable in Shadow Dance.\nViper's Agh's Scepter Corrosive Skin will basically instagib Slark if he activates Dark Pact on you. This is because Agh's Scepter makes Corrosive Skin deal the first instance of damage the moment the debuff is applied. So if it's constantly getting removed by Dark Pact's dispel and then immediately re-applied by Dark Pact's damage, bye bye Slarky."

        "name": "Medusa",
        "guide": "Tips\nSplit Shot hits creeps if you're targeting a tower, but it won't hit a tower if you're attacking creeps.\nIf you're hitting a single target and Split Shot is toggled on, you're still taking the damage reduction. Stop attacking Rosh, finishing jungle camps, or pushing creepless towers with Split Shot on.\nIllusions will either have Split Shot on or off depending on how you had it toggled before they spawned.\nMystic Snake bounces are not random. The Snake will always take the shortest possible bounce once it reaches a target.\nThis means that a Mystic Snake targeted on a melee creep will almost always bounce between other melee creeps before jumping to the ranged creep because they're always so tightly packed. It also means that if a hero is hanging around near their ranged creep, the Snake will almost definitely bounce to them before going to the rest of the creep wave.\nMystic Snake gains damage for each subsequent target it hits. Don't shoot the Snake directly at the enemy hero in lane if you want to get the max damage.\nA general rule of thumb for determining if a jungle creep has a mana pool: If they have an active spell, they have mana. You can always left click on them to find out for sure. Camps where all the creeps have mana, like Satyr or Mud Golem camps and the Golem or Thunderhide ancient camps, are great sources to refill yourself.\nWhen playing against a Rubick, be sure to toggle Split Shot after casting Mystic Snake to give him a worse spell to steal.\nThe \"Safety Bubble\" neutral item provides a barrier that'll prevent your HP from getting hit. As a result, you'll be able to use Blink Dagger even while taking damage because Blink Dagger only breaks when you lose HP.\nIllusions benefit from the \"Safety Bubble\" barrier.\nDebuff immunity (like from BKB) blocks the mana burn from Diffusal Blade.\nMagic resistance (like from BKB) doesn't really improve your survivability. Mana Shield calculates damage before any reductions are factored in, so all you're reducing is the 2% of damage that goes through to your HP.\nIf you have Agh's Scepter, the Snake shot out from Agh's Shard Cold Blooded will also stone the target.\nCounters\nYour all-purpose mana burners can be good against Dusa early/mid game. Invoker (EMP), Nyx Assassin (Vendetta), Lion (Mana Drain), Silencer (Glaives of Wisdom), Anti-Mage (Mana Break), Bane (Fiend's Grip) are obvious counterpicks. Heroes who easily build Diffusal Blade can also be useful for burning her mana.\nStone Gaze will petrify you after you look at her for 2 cumulative seconds. Turning away from her doesn't reset the timer; it'll continue counting down from where the timer left off when you start looking at her again.\nYou can't dispel the 2 second Gaze timer, but you can dodge the petrification with banishes. You still count as facing Medusa even if you're in a banish (including Eul's cyclone), so if you time it properly, the stun will trigger while you're in your banish. When you exit the banish, you won't be stunned and a new 2 second timer will begin.\nWindranger can attack Medusa during Stone Gaze while walking away with Focus Fire. Razor can attack Medusa during Stone Gaze while walking away with Static Link.\nActivating Phase Boots on melee heroes can improve your turn rate when dealing with Stone Gaze.\nMars's Bulwark active can redirect Split Shot attacks to Mars.\nMedusa is a ranged hero so Halberd's disarm lasts longer on her.\nBreaks can disable Split Shot.\nInfused Raindrop can protect you from a lot of potential Mystic Snake damage in lane.\nDamage amplification isn't very effective against Medusa since Mana Shield blocks damage before any other factors, like magic resistance or armor, are calculated.\nLifesteal isn't very effective against Medusa since you deal very little damage to her actual HP and that's what lifesteal calculates off of.\nElder Titan's Echo Stomp is great against Medusa since enemies only wake up once they take a certain amount of damage. But Medusa isn't taking that much damage, her Mana Shield is. So you can beat her to death without her waking up.\nOracle's Purifying Flames are a cute counter against Medusa since you don't really care about her healing. Nuke down her Mana Shield, who cares if she gets a little bit of HP back afterwards.\nIllusions of Medusa are very tanky because they get Mana Shield. This makes spells like Dark Seer's Wall of Replica, Grimstroke's Agh's Scepter Dark Portrait, or Shadow Demon's Disruption pretty annoying counters.\nDespite her illusions having Mana Shield, they can be instagibbed just like any other non-strong illusion, like from Lion's Mana Drain, Disruptor's Glimpse, Pugna's Life Drain, Pudge's Meat Hook, Dazzle's Agh's Shard Poison Touch, hexes, and Dagon."

        "guide": "Tips\nEvery attribute is harder, better, faster, and stronger in melee form. Typically the only reasons you should be in ranged form after the laning phase is to cast the ranged Whirling Axes, get hits on an enemy if you're blocked out by something like Earthshaker's Fissure or Clockwerk's Cogs, or to get one very last hit on an enemy before they escape. If you're trying to stay safe during a push, it can also be worthwhile to siege in ranged form.\nYou can toggle Berserker's Rage forms while channeling a TP.\nIf you're toggled into melee Berserker's Rage when your ranged attack projectile connects, it will land as a 'melee' attack. Toggled attacks can't get the melee Berserker's Rage root, but they can cleave in front of your hero, apply the melee version of attack modifiers, and they will never miss uphill, which can be relevant in the mid lane.\nThe only exception is bonus damage from Quelling Blade will not take the melee value if you swap mid-attack.\nYou can kill couriers from range with one attack if you toggle into melee Berserker's Rage before your attack projectile hits the courier.\nThe ensnare in melee form Berserker's Rage can root debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nWhirling Axes are great wave clearing spells, but Troll runs out of magic juice fast with his terrible INT gain. Keep eyes on your mana pool.\nNeither the blind, nor the damage, from Whirling Axes (Melee) work on Rosh.\nIllusions can independently build up Fervor stacks.\nFervor attack speed persists through death. This is important to know after you respawn (including from Aegis) or buyback. If you go back to hitting the same hero you were attacking before you died, you'll keep the speed and resume adding Fervor stacks accordingly.\nFervor attack speed only resets once an attack lands on a new enemy. When farming jungle camps, take advantage of residual Fervor stacks from a dead camp by walking to a new camp, swapping to ranged form once in attack range, and tossing a few ranged projectiles utilizing your existing Fervor stacks before the first Fervor-resetting attack projectile lands on a new creep.\nThis quirk is also useful after taking a high ground tower and changing focus onto barracks. Swap into ranged form after the tower goes down and you can toss a few ranged projectiles onto the nearest barracks to build up stacks with the max Fervor off the tower.\nAgh's Shard Fervor secondary attacks can hit creeps if you're targeting a tower, but they'll never target the tower if you're attacking creeps.\nAgh's Shard Fervor secondary attacks can proc attack modifiers.\nCasting Battle Trance applies a basic dispel on your hero.\nWith the \"Battle Trance Strong Dispels\" talent you can activate the spell while you're stunned or cycloned.\nMechanically, activating Battle Trance is like having a Dazzle Shallow Grave cast on Troll. So whatever interactions work against Shallow Grave (like dying through Axe's Culling Blade, but not instantly shattering to Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast) are true with Battle Trance as well.\nWhen locked on to a target during Battle Trance, you can't control your movement, but you can toggle Berserker's Rage forms, cast both Whirling Axes, and cast items.\nYou won't have to turn to face a target when casting items.\nYou can't channel a TP if you're Battle Tranced onto a target.\nYou can't attack in Battle Trance while you're feared, but you will stay moving towards your Trance target.\nYou can force yourself to stay permanently locked on a target by casting Battle Trance while you're in the middle of your attack animation. For example, if you want to stay attacking a tower and don't want an enemy walking by to pull your Battle Trance aggro, cast Battle Trance while you're mid-attack animation on the tower. You'll stick to the tower until it dies. This also works on Roshan or ward-type units.\nYou'll chase a target until it dies once you're locked on in Battle Trance. However, if your target is outside your ranged form attack range, you can reacquire the nearest available target by toggling into melee form.\nIf a target is about to fog you, consider activating Battle Trance just to keep them in vision. You maintain shared vision through fog of war when they're the focus of your Trance.\nCounters\nTroll's no Ursa, but be aware that he can still solo Rosh fairly early in the game.\nThe blind on Whirling Axes (Melee) is obnoxious and usually worth getting one of the King Bars (MKB or BKB) for. It also means that you need to be very careful when ganking him if you rely heavily on right clicks for damage.\nTroll's entire kit revolves around making chop suey out of a single target. If he has to switch focus before killing a target, you're doing a good job dealing with him. Force Staffs, Ghost Scepter, Eulses, and banishes are all ideal counters.\nTroll gets shared vision on a locked target during Battle Trance if they're within the acquisition range, so you can't fog him to lose aggro.\nTroll ignores taunts when in Battle Trance.\nA Battle Tranced Troll won't run away when being feared, but he can't attack during the fear duration.\nTroll is immune to move speed slows while in Battle Trance.\nAxe can Culling Blade instagib Troll even when he's in Battle Trance.\nMonkey King can instantly lose a Battle Tranced Troll's aggro by going into Mischief."

        "guide": "Tips\nDouble Edge costs no mana, so use it as your primary pushing spell late game.\nRetaliate damages towers. Be a boss and draw aggro from the tower to speed up the pushing process. If you ever want to force aggro, just right click any enemy hero anywhere on the map while you're in tower range, or attack+move their top bar portrait if they're in vision, or just be the closest target attacking the tower.\nAll Returned damage under the \"Retaliate Aura\" talent credits Centaur as the damage source.\nPay attention to when you can use Stampede from across the map. If your boy Shadow Fiend is getting ganked, don't be shy about turning on your lawnmower with R. Similarly, if SF is ganking an enemy Luna, but just can't keep up, use your ultimate.\nStampede boosts the move speed of all allied heroes and summons, excluding ward-type units. All Stampeding units can apply the slow on enemies.\nCounters\nAttacks from Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon, Luna's Moon Glaives, or Medusa's Split Shot won't trigger Retaliate unless Centaur is the primary target.\nNyx Assassin can easily stun Centaur since Retaliate damage can be reflected with Spiked Carapace just by right clicking him."

        "guide": "Tips\nIf you ground target Shockwave from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\nThis is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\nShockwave's forced movement can't cancel enemy channels, but can take enemies out of Shadow Amulet or take Templar Assassin out of Meld.\nUse Shockwave's pull after you Reverse Polarity enemies to move them behind you for easy Skewering.\nRanged allies still benefit from Empower bonus damage. You can't give Windranger cleavage, but I'm sure she wouldn't mind the extra damage.\nEmpower only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not raw damage (green damage) items.\nSkewer only goes as far as you click if you're not maxing out the range. I know you're really excited that you actually landed a 3-man RP, now just pan the camera over a bit before casting Skewer so you can bring the enemies to your team.\nThat being said, no one is forcing you to always Skewer the max distance. You can also use it at close range mid-gank to inject enemies with the move speed slow or use it to destroy a treeline to help your team close a gap.\nWhen Skewering to escape, don't freaking carpool with the people who are ganking you. It's smart to go past cliffs with Skewer, but it's dumb if you're bringing the enemy with you. Choose a Skewer destination that is not only far, but also at an angle that won't drag undesirables along for the ride.\nYou can use a close range Shockwave to set up for a Skewer since the enemy may get pulled behind your hero.\nSkewer's grab AoE is a circle around Magnus, not just the front of his horn. Enemies can be behind Magnus and you'll still pull them if they're close enough to your hero.\nUsing Harpoon on an enemy will always bring the target into Skewer's pull AoE if you're fast.\nBy default, your team of random pubs will generally assume that you're not going to Skewer after a good Reverse Polarity if they're close by. It's worth sacrificing the positional benefit from Skewer just to make sure you're not causing your teammates to whiff their spells on where they thought the enemies would be.\nKeep your finger primed on your 'stop' hotkey when you're initiating or ganking. It's pretty easy to tell when you're about to whiff your RP, so be prepared to cancel your cast.\nFaking RP can also be useful to bait certain spells that could evade your stun on reaction, like Puck Phase Shift or Phantom Lancer Doppelganger.\nAfter you Blink into the enemy team, right click behind you as you cast RP. This'll get Magnus to rotate as you're casting RP and all the enemies get stunned at the desired Skewer angle without you having to cast Shockwave to pull them behind you.\nCounters\nMagnus cannot cast Skewer while rooted/leashed.\nWhen you're mid against Mag, it's obvious when he's trying to push the lane and quickly kill the full wave. He's going to auto attack all the creeps a bit and then he's going to Shockwave at whatever angle will finish the most creeps. There isn't much you can do to stop this, but at least don't get hit by the Shockwave that isn't even meant for you.\nIf you're worried about Magnus blinking in on your team and starting a team fight, you can try spam casting a disable on the ground near your team. You may end up clicking on him the moment he blinks in.\nIf you have vision of Magnus, you can keep casting and canceling your disable so that the moment he blinks it, your hero will immediately target him with the spell. This is especially useful with instant disables like the cyclone from Eul's."

        "name": "Timbersaw",
        "guide": "Tips\nWhirling Death can be activated while you're mid-Timber Chain.\nBe generous when targeting Timber Chain. It's okay to sacrifice ~50 range to ensure you aren't whiffing Chains.\nTimber Chain gives a very small slice of vision as it travels and gives 400 ground vision for a split second once it reaches max distance. You can use this to quickly scout inside the Rosh pit if you don't want to spend Chakram for vision.\nIf you Eul's yourself after casting Timber Chain, you'll fly up and the cyclone will get canceled once the Chain hits a tree. Use this to dodge enemies who may try to cancel your Chain cast with stuns.\nUsing Blink Dagger immediately after casting Timber Chain allows you to change your angle of approach to a targeted tree. You can use this to get Chain damage on an enemy and still quickly return to safety. You can also toss a Chain, blink into a creep wave and Whirling Death, and promptly fly out.\nIf you and your lane partner have amazing communication, you may be able to catch enemies off guard by having an ally plant an Iron Branch right on top of an enemy to give you a surprise Timber Chain target.\nYou can cast Chakram before Timber Chain connects or during the travel time to cut down on the Chakram cast animation. Timber will start the animation for Chakram as soon as he's in range of wherever you targeted it. Shift+queueing Chakram after casting Chain is the guaranteed fastest way to do this.\nRemember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro to help build Reactive Armor stacks.\nYou can even use the top bar portraits to draw aggro. If you see an enemy hero is in vision on your minimap, you can attack+move (default A+left click) the enemy top bar portrait and it'll issue an attack command which'll draw creep aggro without having to move your camera.\nGo into the jungle and tank a few neutrals to build up Reactive Armor stacks before a gank/dive.\nThe Agh's Scepter Reactive Armor active can be dispelled by enemies, but you'll deal the explosion damage when the buff is removed.\nAn enemy can receive the burst damage from the Chakram once when it flies out and once when it's coming back. So if it looks like an enemy is about to escape the AoE of the Chakram, just return it while they're still in it. The extra passthrough damage will be more useful than a few more milliseconds of slow.\nThe lower an enemy's HP, the greater the Chakram slow will be.\nTimbersaw is disarmed when a Chakram is out.\nIf you're trying to prevent someone from Blinking out when they're exiting a banish or Eul's or respawning from Aegis, don't expect a stationary Chakram to reliably cancel their Dagger. A Chakram in place only deals damage during set intervals. However, a moving Chakram checks for units to damage every tick that it's traveling. So time your Chakram cast/return so that it's moving underneath the enemy when they appear.\nLearn the trees on the map. There are many unique juke paths that only Timber can take advantage of thanks to his skill set.\nWhen escaping late game, try carving out paths with Chakram before Timber Chaining. Timber Chaining into a deforested area could buy you a few seconds of fog.\nAgh's Shard Flamethrower can damage buildings.\nAgh's Shard Flamethrower sets trees on fire as well. They will be destroyed after burning for 5 seconds.\nCounters\nDon't stand next to trees when laning against or escaping from a Timbersaw. The distance you're saving by hugging the treeline won't matter when he purely damages your ass.\nIn lane, consider constantly cutting down trees if you have a Quelling Blade. You'll give Timbersaw fewer angles to Chain off of or fewer trees to get Whirling Death damage off of.\nThe \"Light Collector\" neutral item's active can destroy trees in an AoE around you which can help counter Timber Chain or Whirling Death.\nTimbersaw hates being silenced, especially if he has a Chakram out because that means he literally can't do anything.\nTimbersaw cannot Timber Chain when rooted or leashed.\nIf you have an Iron Branch in lane and wanna go for big plays, you can try planting a tree right in front of Timber when he's trying to escape and intercept his Timber Chain cast. Other players besides Arteezy probably do this, but no one cares when they do it.\nBreaking Timbersaw will stop him from gaining new Reactive Armor stacks, but existing stacks will remain.\nSpirit Vessel can help mitigate the HP regen Timber gains from Reactive Armor. Skadi and Shiva's also reduce HP regen.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing like from Reactive Armor.\nChakram has a fairly slow travel time, so it's usually worth sacrificing some positioning if it means you can sidestep the saw when he's chasing you.\nIf you disable Timbersaw at any point after the Chain projectile comes out, he'll stop moving. If your team has a shortage of stuns, save them for when you see his Chain come out as opposed to preventing him from casting the spell at all. That way his Chain goes on cooldown, but he won't go anywhere.\nBe mindful when right click harassing him in lane. Often times, Timber's prefer the Reactive stacks. Ideally you want to harass him with magic damage exclusively, if possible.\nIf you're a strength hero, Whirling Death's primary attribute loss debuff will make you extremely vulnerable in lane.\nYou can remove the Agh's Scepter Reactive Armor barrier with basic dispels, but Timbersaw will explode the moment it's dispelled."

        "name": "Bristleback",
        "guide": "Tips\nViscous Nasal Goo's armor reduction works on Rosh. Combined with his good tanking ability, teams with Bristle can take Rosh fairly early.\nIf you're against heroes with global skills (Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, Clockwerk's Rocket Flare, Invoker's Sun Strike, Zeus's Thundergod's Wrath), be sure to face in the inside of your fountain when healing to take advantage the Bristleback passive. Reduction is calculated based on your orientation to the source of the damage.\nSpam spells to keep Warpath stacks up when roaming around the map if you have the mana regen to support it.\nBristleback is a highly effective hero to take advantage of stacked ancients with. With a few items you should be able to take ancients literally without even looking thanks to Quill Spray.\nIf you are in a rush when taking stacked ancients, consider backpacking any armor/block items you have so that your Bristleback passive procs more often since you're taking more damage.\nGround targeting a TP allows you to continue facing in whichever direction you clicked the TP. If you want to travel out of a fight, but don't want to turn around because enemies are attacking your back, ground target your TP in front of you. You won't go back to the fountain, you'll just travel to the nearest structure from where you clicked.\nAgh's Scepter Bristleback will lock your facing direction while active. Doesn't matter if you're Dueled by Legion Commander or being Sinister Gazed by Lich, your hero may move, but it'll continue facing the locked direction.\nAgh's Scepter Bristleback's active also allows you to cast spells and items without turning to face the cast location. This includes items like Blink Dagger or channeling a TP scroll.\nEach Quill Spray from Agh's Scepter Bristleback adds a Warpath stack.\nBristle is tied for the fastest turn rate in the game. If you're laning against a ranged hero with a slow projectile, you should absolutely take advantage of this by gracefully pirouetting before each right click projectile hits your hero.\nCounters\nMagic Wand is core against this guy ALL GAME LONG. Unlike other heroes who stop spamming once the laning phase ends, Bristle needs to mash his spells for the whole game. No matter what role you're playing, you should always get a Stick, Wand, or Holy Locket.\nHeroes that can force Bristleback to face a certain direction are useful for bypassing his Bristleback damage reduction. So heroes with taunts, like Axe's Berserker's Call or Legion Commander's Duel, or other directional fears, like Void Spirit's Aether Remnant or Lich's Sinister Gaze.\nBristleback damage reduction is calculated based on his orientation to the hero who owns the source of damage he's taking. Summons (Zeus Nimbus, Lone Druid Spirit Bear, Visage Familiars) deal damage based on their own position, not the hero who summoned them.\nYou can dispel Goo stacks (Manta, Satanic, Eul's, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves, Disperser, etc). You cannot dispel Quill stacks.\nCasting Eul's to cyclone Bristleback's Agh's Scepter active will make him shoot his Quills in random directions while he's spinning in the air.\nBristle is all about whittling down your armor and barraging you with physical damage. Stacking armor helps mitigate his damage output.\nQuill Spray is physical damage, so if you get a Ghost Scepter this guy can't do anything except wipe his nose on you.\nYou can Break the Bristleback passive. This makes an item like Silver Edge fairly core against Bristle. Spells that Break like Hoodwink's Sharpshooter, Viper's Viper Strike, Phantom Assassin's Agh's Shard Fan of Knives, Shadow Demon's Agh's Scepter Demonic Purge, and a few other spells can be quite useful."

        "name": "Tusk",
        "guide": "Tips\nIce Shards has beastly range, but the projectile travels pretty slow. If you're going for a long range Shard, try to save it for when the enemy is moving into a chokepoint or just block the choke in advance.\nThe easiest way to 'reverse Shard' yourself is to target the cast of Ice Shards in front of your hero model, but inside of the white selection circle. With surprisingly little practice you can start cliffing yourself like a pro.\nIf you want to take the guesswork out of it, you can also use shift+queueing. Right click to move as usual, then ever so slightly move your mouse ahead of that right click and shift+queue an Ice Shard right in front of your move command. If you want to go one more level, you can then shift+queue another move command after and you'll do the whole motion fluidly without ever stopping.\nYou can also use this technique to escape a Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Slark's Pounce leash.\nThe Ice Shards projectile provides flying vision as it travels. The vision remains briefly around the Shards landing location.\nYou can use Ice Shards to help get vision of a neutral creep in the jungle to Snowball to if you're getting ganked and there are no good targets nearby.\nThink about your Snowball target when trying to save yourself or allies. Don't always target enemy heroes, they may move in a way that'll drag you further into a fight. Instead, look for neutrals or lane creeps that will move you to a safer and more predictable location once your Snowball ends.\nYou, and anyone else in you wrap up, are completely invulnerable while inside Snowball. This means that you can use this as a poor man's banish to protect allies if they're about to get killed.\nYou can pull allies into Snowball by right-clicking them. You can even use this while you're rolling mid-Snowball to pick up new heroes.\nYou can pull allies into Snowball even when they're cycloned. You need to have the \"Right Click Allies\" option set \"To Follow/Deny\" for this to work, not \"To Attack.\"\nAllies can jump into your Snowball themselves if they right click it, but only if they're not disabled (stunned/rooted).\nYou can pick up runes while sitting or rolling in Snowball, but allies cannot. This can be handy to know during Wisdom rune battles.\nWhen contesting dangerous Wisdom runes, you can also consider pre-aggroing the nearby neutral camp, walking over to the rune spot, then targeting Snowball on the neutrals while they're returning to give yourself an exit strategy.\nSnowball isn't blocked by Linken's Sphere.\nSnowballing a target with Lotus Orb will put them into a Snowball targeting you once your Snowball lands on them. They can't launch their Snowball early so they'll be stuck in it for the full duration.\nYou can cast Ice Shards and Tag Team while you're in the Snowball.\nYou can Agh's Scepter Walrus Kick people while you're in the Snowball.\nThis is important because it's really hard to target someone with Snowball while they're mid-Kick flight if you want to follow them back. Target them with Snowball first, then Walrus Kick them, then start rolling towards them.\nYou can't Snowball allies that are affected by Enigma's Black Hole, Faceless Void's Chronosphere, or Batrider's Flaming Lasso.\nYou also can't Snowball allies that are under Primal Beast's Pulverize. This one's especially important because if you attempt to gather an ally being Pulverized, the game will act like you did gather them and restrict you from pulling them in even after the Pulverize ends. Your ally won't be able to hop in the Snowball themselves either.\nTag Team works on neutrals and Roshan.\nSince the Tag Team bonus damage is calculated as \"+green\" bonus damage for each attack, you can cleave, lifesteal, and crit off it. This includes boosting Walrus Punch's crit, so always enable Tag Team before Walrus Punching for a big damage increase.\nTag Team's effects only work on attacks from Tusk, units Tusk owns, allied heroes, and allied illusions (though illusions only apply the slow since the damage bonus is \"+green\" damage which illusions can't use). Attacks from units/summons owned by allied heroes don't get any Tag Team bonuses.\nYou can Walrus Punch enemy couriers. Not really useful, but funny as a statement play.\nYou can also Agh's Scepter Walrus Kick enemy couriers, but it won't damage them. This is marginally more useful since maybe you'll spot an enemy courier in Kick range but not Punch range.\nWalrus Punch attacks have true strike.\nWalrus Punch (and Agh's Scepter Walrus Kick) breaks channels, even if the enemy is debuff immune/BKB'd.\nWalrus Punch ignores Linken's Sphere and Lotus Orb.\nAgh's Scepter Walrus Kick does get blocked by Linken's Sphere. If you Walrus Kick a target who has a Lotus Orb buff, your hero will be kicked towards the middle of the Dota map irrespective of the angle you kicked your target.\nCounters\nIce Shards is dangerous in lane because of how it affects pathing. You need to add some extra space in your safe zone to compensate for it. The distance you have to move to walk out of the Shards doesn't seem like much, but you set yourself up for skillshot disables or free harass.\nTusk and all his allies are invulnerable in his Snowball, so don't cast your spells until the ball breaks apart.\nTusk can't cast Snowball when rooted/leashed.\nSnowball and Walrus Punch completely ignore Linken's Sphere.\nLotus Orbing a Snowball will stick you in your own Snowball once Tusk lands on you. Since you don't have a Snowball hotkey, you can't launch it early, but you can pick up nearby allies and even cast your spells while inside your reflected Snowball."

        "name": "Skywrath Mage",
        "guide": "Tips\nArcane Bolt gives vision as it travels. This is useful when enemies are in fog as you can use the brief vision before impact to get in one auto-attack if the enemy is hiding in trees or on high ground.\nThe vision provided by Arcane Bolt on impact can also help land a Concussive Shot since Concussive can only fly to heroes if you have vision of them.\nBe aware that enemies only get Stick charges if the caster of a spell is in vision. If you're spamming Arcane Bolt against enemies with Sticks, try to cast while hiding in tree fog.\nConcussive Shot has zero cast time. If you have the mana, always cast it if you're getting chased.\nConcussive Shot will never select illusions to hit. If you're against a hero who uses a lot of illusions, save Concussive for when you want to find the real one.\nIf there are no heroes in range, Concussive Shot will instead hit the nearest creep.\nAncient Seal is the only single-targeted instant (zero cast time) silence in the game besides Orchid. The magic amplification is nice and all, but a guaranteed targeted silence is what makes this skill amazing. Cast+cancel this constantly on enemy initiators before a team fight so you can instantly silence them when they try Blinking into your team.\nEnemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Ancient Seal). If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nIf you are free-balling a Mystic Flare, prediction and practice are your best bets to landing it consistently. You want the enemy to walk into the middle of the Flare half a second after you cast and then think to themselves, \"Well, great, now it doesn't matter which direction I walk, I'm eating this ult.\"\nMystic Flare damage works on Rosh.\nAfter picking up an Agh's Scepter, all your spells will randomly search around your primary target for additional targets that are not in fog, prioritizing heroes.\nIf you have the \"Global Concussive Shot\" talent, both Shots will search globally. The first Shot will hit the closest target like normal, but the second shot will pick another global target at random.\nAgh's Scepter multicasts also bypass things like Linken's Sphere or Lotus Orb. Since heroes are prioritized as secondary targets, you can fairly reliably cast Ancient Seal on solo heroes with Linken's by casting the silence on a nearby creep.\nAgh's Scepter Mystic Flare attempts to place the secondary Mystic Flare on the center of a nearby hero. However, if there's already a Mystic Flare AoE on the center of a hero, it won't place a second one on top. So if you're trying to hit a single hero with double Mystic Flares, target your first Flare so that the edge of the AoE does not cover the middle of the enemy. If placed correctly, you should be able to hit a single hero with two Mystic Flares.\nCounters\nAvoid trying to outrun Arcane Bolt unless you have some plan to not die to it. It's going to hit you regardless, all you're doing is giving the enemy team a tiny little ward that's giving away your location as you run.\nYou can quickly move a Raindrop into your backpack to protect charges from weak Arcane Bolts.\nIf Skywrath is spamming Arcane Bolt, get a Magic Stick. Just be aware that the Stick only gets charges if you have vision on the hero when they cast a spell.\nAfter Skywrath blows his mana load spamming spells at level 1, he'll probably start sipping Clarities in the corner like a junkie. Don't let him.\nConcussive Shot has a small AoE on impact. Avoid clumping up around the target that Concussive Shot is tailing.\nConcussive Shot can only target you if Skywrath has vision of you. Try utilizing fog from trees when getting chased by Sky.\nIf you get hit by a random Concussive in the late game, it's possible Skywrath took the \"Global Concussive Shot\" talent and cast the spell when you were walking under some wards.\nBeware of the Mystic Flare combos on the enemy team. Nature's Prophet's Sprout or Clockwerk's Power Cogs may be annoying spells by themselves, but they become killboxes with a Skywrath. If this is a concern, get a Force Staff or Eul's.\nIf Skywrath gets a Rod of Atos and is rooting you into Mystic Flare combos, remember that the Rod root can be dispelled by items like Manta Style, Satanic, Guardian Greaves, Lotus Orb, or Disperser.\nOracle with Fate's Edict providing magic damage immunity can be annoying for Skywrath to deal with.\nPugna can be a real pain for Skywrath because all of his spells cost a ton of mana and Nether Ward hurts."

        "guide": "Tips\nThe self-damage on Mist Coil can be absorbed by Aphotic Shield and will heal you during Borrowed Time.\nAphotic Shield is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off most disables and debuffs, including stuns.\nYou can cast Aphotic Shield on creeps. Handy for split pushing.\nAphotic Shield will always detonate for the full damage regardless of damage absorbed even if it gets dispelled off.\nYou can replace a Shield on a target to detonate it on demand for the damage.\nAphotic Shield's explosion won't damage units in fog or invisible units, even if they're in the AoE.\nThe Aphotic Shield buff lasts for quite a while, so you can consider casting it on yourself for free in the fountain before TPing to a lane.\nAbaddon's cast animations are long and the cast range on Aphotic Shield is garbage. If you're pushing/defending with your team and you're worried about enemy initiation, try casting and canceling Aphotic Shield on your team's highest priority hero. Not only will this constantly keep you in range to cast the Shield, but if you've got godlike reactions you can almost instantly wipe off any disable.\nIf you or an ally gets attacked while Aphotic Shield is on, the game will act like you haven't taken damage. This means that Salves, Clarities, Bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, and sleeps won't get broken.\nBorrowed Time also means you don't receive 'damage,' so you can take advantage of all the aforementioned interactions under Borrowed Time as well. Mainly useful for Blinking during Borrowed Time.\nAphotic Shield doesn't absorb any damage during Borrowed Time, all of it goes to healing.\nIllusions of Abaddon can add Curse of Avernus stacks.\nCurse of Avernus works on buildings.\nYou can manually activate Borrowed Time for a strong dispel even when stunned or under other types of non-silence disables.\nIt can be worth manually triggering Borrowed Time if you and your whole team are stunned. That way you can strong dispel off your stun and then immediately put an Aphotic Shield on an ally to dispel their stun as well.\nBreak prevents Borrowed Time from auto-triggering, so you'll need to manually cast it against Silver Edge carriers or other Breaks. Be sure to check at the beginning of the game if there are any potential Agh's Shards/Scepters or talents that provide Breaks before they get you killed.\nAbaddon is an ideal hero to keep auras on (Vlad's, Drum, Shiva's) since he takes too much time for teams to kill early on in a fight.\nCounters\nThe burst damage radius on Aphotic Shield is pretty huge, but it doesn't damage targets in fog. If a target with Aphotic Shield is trying to explode on you, try to juke them in trees and stay out of vision.\nAphotic Shield can be dispelled off enemies. However, it will explode for the full damage once dispelled.\nCurse of Avernus stacks and the full silence debuff can both be dispelled.\nSince Abaddon illusions can apply Curse of Avernus stacks, Terrorblade's Reflection or Shadow Demon's Disruption can be annoying for Abaddon to deal with.\nIf you have a nuke that does >400 damage, you can instakill Abaddon without Borrowed Time ever auto triggering.\nBorrowed Time will auto-trigger even if Abaddon is silenced/hexed.\nYou can Break Abaddon so Borrowed Time won't auto-trigger and then silence him so Borrowed Time can't be manually cast to work around his ultimate.\nEul's Scepter can be a useful Abaddon counter since it can waste a few seconds of Borrowed Time while he's spinning in the air.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing, such as from Borrowed Time.\nSpirit Vessel can lower the amount of HP he'll heal in Borrowed Time, assuming he doesn't dispel it with Aphotic Shield. Items like Shiva's or Skadi can also provide heal reduction."

        "guide": "Tips\nIf you Echo Stomp while the Spirit isn't out, both the magical and physical damage instances will work off your hero.\nDon't start whaling on an enemy as soon as you land the Sleep. Get a better position, let your team get into a better position, then go to town.\nEcho Stomped targets will wake up only after they take a certain amount of total damage.\nCast Echo Stomp when the Spirit is on its way back home. Cast the Spirit, step on some fools, then have it walk down the lane so the enemy team will forget about it. Then when it's on the way back, cast Echo Stomp and your Spirit's hips will start moving on their own~. Since the Spirit returns way faster than it walks normally, players won't always react quick enough to dodge it.\nIf you spam your 'stop' hotkey to cancel Echo Stomp's cast animation when the Spirit is returning, you can slightly extend the time it takes for the Spirit to return to your hero.\nThere is no difference between casting Echo Stomp from your Spirit or from your hero. However, if your hero is taunted, you can cast Echo Stomp from your Spirit and then both your hero and the Spirit will start channeling the spell. This only works when taunted, not under stuns, silences, sleeps, or fears.\nThe Spirit walks around as fast as ET is at the time of casting. This means that a Dark Seer Surge'd ET will have a Surge-speed Spirit.\nThis makes Phase Boots surprisingly great on ET since you can activate Phase and then cast Spirit and have it roam around at Phased speeds for its entire duration.\nNatural Order armor reduction aura is centered around the hero, and the magical reduction aura is centered around the Spirit.\nNatural Order removes base armor and magic resistance, which comes from AGI and INT respectively.\nHaving your Spirit sit around on enemies in lane just for Natural Order is useless if you're not planning on attacking them any time soon. Have your Spirit go suck up some more damage/farm by sending it into jungle camps rather than sitting around spooning heroes.\nThe Spirit can take Twin Gates. It takes forever for it to come back from its semester abroad, but it may step on a lot of damage on the way back.\nYou can use a long-distance Spirit Return to your advantage to set up for kills. Spirit starts cooling down whenever it's cast, not whenever it's Returned. When the Spirit finally returns, start pounding on people with the extra bonus damage and you'll have another Spirit cooldown ready in the chamber to finish them off.\nIt can be in your benefit to stack neutral camps near your lane so you can gain a lot of damage by running your Spirit over more creeps.\nIf your hero is within ~1800 range of a neutral camp, you can draw aggro and stack it with Astral Spirit.\nWhatever Spirit bonus buffs you have are immediately replaced by new values when returning a new Spirit.\nUse the Spirit to scout out fogged areas during pushes or defenses.\nDuring chases, try to pincer your target by casting the Spirit on a choke point. Either they have to run through the whole thing and risk getting Stomped or they have to change directions.\nYou can right click an enemy when your Spirit is selected to have it follow the target for its duration.\nIdeally, you want to cast Earth Splitter as far away from the enemy team as possible to give them the smallest amount of time to react to the crack approaching.\nCounters\nWith shpeed. Elder Titan is a very unwieldy hero. His Stomp is slow, his Spirit is slow, Earth Splitter is slow. If you can move fast and avoid his spells, you can evade a lot of damage that ET should be dealing to you.\nAlong those lines, Force Staff gives you an easy eject button if you're getting comboed into some of his spells.\nThe Astral Spirit buff can be dispelled off of Elder Titan. This can make heroes like Enchantress with Enchant or Oracle with Fortune's End handy in the laning phase.\nOracle can wake allies up from Echo Stomp with Purifying Flames damage. Pudge can wake himself up with Rot.\nElder Titans will often stack your camps in lane just so they can get more Spirit damage. It sounds crazy, but you should try blocking your own camps to stop him from doing this."

Doesn't matter if you're banished, stunned, silenced, hexed, and Doomed. You can still cast Overwhelming Odds mid-Duel.\nThe only exception is if you're Feared. Fears are actually the strongest disable in the game apparently.\nPress the Attack is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off most disables and debuffs, including stuns.\nStrategically draw aggro from creeps by clicking enemy heroes to potentially get a Moment of Courage proc when going for last hits or denies.\nIt can be worth keeping neutral creeps alive with minimal HP so they give you more chances to proc Moment of Courage.\nYou can milk a lot of lifesteal from a single creep wave or jungle camp by standing still while drawing aggro and watching Moment of Courage's cooldown/buff. Every time the spell procs, use the Moment of Courage attack for lifesteal. This way you give yourself more Moment of Courage opportunities by only killing off the wave with lifestealing attacks.\nThe standard max-greed Duel procedure is using Press the Attack, activating any items (like Blade Mail or BKB), then Dueling your target. You'll need to trim ingredients in the combo as the game progresses in order to get the Duel off quicker and to not alert enemies to your presence before jumping in.\nIf you have a Shadow Blade/Silver Edge, Dueling straight out of invis won't give the bonus Backstab damage unless you right click the enemy first since Duel counts as a spell and spells end invisibility.\nTread switching is an important thing to utilize on LC since she is a hero with fairly mana intensive spells. Remember to stay off STR treads until the healing from Press the Attack is complete, but also remember to not stay on INT treads for 15 minutes straight until someone pings you after a Duel loss and you sheepishly swap back.\nUnlike Axe's Berserker's Call and Winter Wyvern's Winter's Curse, Duel is a taunt that also applies a silence on the target. This means Ursa can't Agh's Scepter Enrage and Abaddon can't manually cast Borrowed Time while Dueled.\nThe \"Vindicator's Axe\" neutral item can be a cute pickup on Legion Commander since you're considered 'silenced' when in Duel.\nYou can earn Duel damage from Wraith King Reincarnation deaths, but not Aegis deaths.\nCounters\nSimple spells to mess with Duel: Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's False Promise, Winter Wyvern's Cold Embrace, Bane's Nightmare, Outworld Destroyer/Shadow Demon/Tusk banishes, Slark's Agh's Shard Depth Shroud, Snapfire Agh's Scepter Gobble Up, Pudge Agh's Shard Dismember.\nSome of these spells outright end the Duel and some of them will have Legion Commander eagerly waiting to attack the target once they emerge from the banish. There isn't really any logic.\nOther ways to mess with Duel include Disarms (ex. Heaven's Halberd) or Ethereal states (ex. Ghost Scepter).\nLC loves going against teams with a bunch of summons thanks to Overwhelming Odds damage, so draft accordingly.\nIf you win a Duel, you don't get the free Press the Attack cast afterwards. Only LC gets that."

        "guide": "Tips\nSticky Bombs will always latch to the nearest hero upon landing.\nSticky Bombs provide a small radius of ground vision when they're spinning around or once they attach to an enemy. You can try throwing a Sticky Bomb on a cliff to scout for wards.\nSticky Bombs destroy trees in a tiny radius around the target point.\nYou can manually detonate Reactive Tazer by pressing the spell hotkey again during the buff.\nAny enemy that gets hit with the Reactive Tazer debuff will also receive a basic dispel.\nEach time a target attacks you, they'll receive the Reactive Tazer damage. This usually can't happen that often during a single cast, but certain multi-attack spells like Pangolier's Swashbuckle can have him tank multiple Reactive Tazer nukes in just one cast.\nIf you're banished while flying in Blast Off, the spell will still land on the target area as expected, but you won't take the self-damage.\nMagic resistance can reduce the Blast Off self damage.\nYou can cast Glimmer Cape on yourself before targeting Blast Off and the magic damage barrier will absorb the self-damage.\nRespect the z-axis when casting Blast Off. If your Blast Off's downwards trajectory arcs over a cliff, you may end up landing on the cliff instead of your targeted AoE.\nYou can use Blast Off to escape a Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nIf you plant a Proximity Mine directly underneath yourself after Blasting Off into some enemies, they may struggle to right click it underneath your hero model.\nEven more frustrating is if they try to destroy your mine while your Reactive Tazer is on because then they'll also get disarmed for trying.\nAll placed Proximity Mines will dynamically level up as more points are put into the spell.\nProximity Mines deal damage to buildings. However, remember that Proximity Mines deal less damage the further they are away from the target, so try to place Mines as close to the tower as possible.\nTowers won't ever attack Proximity Mines.\nAgh's Scepter Minefield Sign can trigger on enemy illusions.\nThe Agh's Scepter Minefield Sign is active even during the cast animation. So you can start casting the Minefield Sign on top of an enemy and the surrounding area will instantly become an active Minefield. You can keep casting and canceling the animation without ever committing to planting the Sign in one place.\nSpell damage amplification from items like Kaya does not boost Proximity Mine damage since the Mine itself is the source of the damage as a separate ward unit, not your hero.\nThis also explains why heroes who Blade Mail on your Mines won't deal damage to your hero.\nTake advantage of dropping/backpacking INT/mana items to get more effective regen when you use Soul Ring or Arcane Boots.\nCounters\nAny type of attack that lands on Techies with Reactive Tazer active will disarm you. This includes instant attacks from spells. So if a Monkey King Boundless Strikes a Tazer'd Techies, he'll get disarmed. If a Phantom Assassin Stifling Dagger's a Tazer'd Techies, she'll get disarmed. If a Medusa Split Shot lands on a Tazer'd Techies... she actually won't get disarmed for some reason. She will if she has her \"Split Shot Uses Modifiers\" talent though. Basically, if the instant attack can also proc attack modifiers, you'll get disarmed. Dota 2, amirite?\nOh, one more note! If your instant attack also banishes you, like Ember Spirit's Sleight of Fist or Riki's Tricks of the Trade, then you won't get disarmed.\nIf you get hit with the Electric Tazer debuff, your hero will also receive a basic dispel which will remove most buffs.\nTechies turns brighter and more... electrick-y when Reactive Tazer is about to pop.\nIf you dispel the Reactive Tazer buff off an enemy, it'll immediately detonate and disarm everything in the AoE.\nDon't listen to music when you're playing against Techies. Proximity Mines make a noise when you walk into the trigger AoE, even through fog.\nInvisible and flying units can trigger and be damaged by Proximity Mines.\nProximity Mines are invisible once armed until you walk into their AoE. Even Gem/sentry wards can't spot them.\nProximity Mines only take one attack to be destroyed. SO PLEASE. ATTACK. THE MINE. Especially, as a carry. Your attack speed is way higher than a support, so you have a much better chance of killing the Mines before they fully arm and explode.\nDamage absorbed from Proximity Mines during Blade Mail does not reflect onto Techies. This is because the Proximity Mine ward unit itself is the source of damage, not Techies. This is also why applying Mage Slayer onto Techies will not reduce Proximity Mine damage.\nAttack+moving will not target Proximity Mines. You have to manually right click each one to attack them.\nStuns and other disables won't stop a Techies that's in flight from a Blast Off, but sources of forced movement can. This means cycloning or Force Staffing or Harpooning a Techies that's Blasting Off will cancel the explosion.\nSpells that move the enemy with vertical forced movement, like Sand King's Burrowstrike, Nyx's Impale, Lion's Earth Spike, and Rubick's Telekinesis, or horizontally, like Drow Ranger's Gust, Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, and Storm Spirit's Electric Vortex, will also cancel the explosion.\nFears like Lich's Sinister Gaze or Lone Druid's Savage Roar can also cancel a flying Blast Off.\nTechies can do very little when getting Battery Assaulted by a Clockwerk since his cast animations take so long.\nAvoid standing close to treelines when pushing against Techies. It's a favorite area for hidden Proximity Mines.\nTechies players loooove going for offensive Force Staff plays, so be very wary if you see that item in his inventory.\nBe very careful when walking up any high ground stairs since there may be a Proximity Mine or two hiding just outside your vision.\nAll of Techies' damage is magical, so items like Glimmer Cape or Pipe can improve your survivability.\nInfused Raindrops can give you some very valuable early game survivability against a Techies."

        "guide": "Tips\nThe capture radius on Searing Chains is fairly large, but that's usually a disadvantage since it means you'll probably catch creeps when you want to catch heroes. When possible, hold on to the Chains until you can position yourself away from worthless enemy units rather than complaining about relying on RNG.\nSearing Chains will not capture units in fog or invisible units, but will provide true sight on captured units.\nWhile Sleighted, projectiles will follow you around as you bounce from unit to unit. It's not a disjoint, but you can use this invulnerability period to 'absorb' projectiles without taking any damage or stun, like from a Gyrocopter Homing Missile for example.\nWhile you are invulnerable, you are not considered 'hidden/banished' in Sleight of Fist or Activate Fire Remnant. That means certain spells that affect invulnerable units, like Silencer's Global Silence, can still affect you while you're in these spells.\nYou can use spells during Sleight of Fist. Yes, Chains is a given, but casting and activating Remnants during Sleight is also important. You can cast Remnants mid-Sleight to close distances quicker when chasing enemies. Activating them at the tail end of a Sleight will also make you extremely difficult to lock down when being chased.\nYou can use items during Sleight of Fist. This includes TP scrolls. Just be sure that your Sleight ends before the TP channel finishes, otherwise you'll be brought back to your Sleight Remnant.\nYou will always return to your Sleight Remnant when Sleight ends. This means you can avoid an enemy Disruptor's Glimpse by being mid-Sleight when Glimpse is supposed to move you and you'll still return to your Sleight Remnant.\nThe hardest part of executing the Sleight+Chains combo on solo targets is knowing when Sleight will actually go off. Don't get too excited and prematurely cast Chains first. Just hit the hotkey as soon as you can react to Ember going into Sleight and you'll probably land it.\nIf you're trying to Sleight+Chain someone who's in a clump of other units, you should save the Chains until later in the Sleight. It's possible you may kill off some other useless units while Sleighting which improves your chances of Chaining the hero.\nYou can slightly influence where Chains will go off when attacking a large group of units. To do so, target Sleight, then shift+queue an attack/right-click command on the unit you want to Chain, then shift+queue Searing Chains. If done correctly, Searing Chains will go off when your hero gets \"close\" to the target you right-clicked. It's easier to do the more units are within the Sleight because you'll have more opportunities to be near your desired Chains target.\nI highly recommend enabling the \"Show Ability Rangefinder While Casting\" interface option in the game settings. For Ember, it becomes far easier to tell when Sleight of Fist will go off when you can see the cast range.\nWhen manfighting early on with a low level Sleight, keep the Sleight in your pocket until the end of the fight. With good timing, you can use the banishment phase of the Sleight to mask the backswing of one of your attacks while tripping up heroes who are mashing right click on you, stalling some potential auto attacks.\nUnlike most other spells involving 'instant attacks,' using Sleight won't break your Smoke when used on creeps.\nAlso, unlike most other instant attacks, Sleight of Fist will deal no damage if you're disarmed and does not have true strike.\nYou can Sleight of Fist a Bane Nightmared unit and they won't wake up. However, if you add damage from Flame Guard or an item proc, they will wake up.\nBecause you're invulnerable when Sleight of Fisting or traveling to a Fire Remnant, you can cast items on Lotus Orbed enemies and it won't get reflected back on your hero.\nSleight of Fist lands on units in fog. Use this to scout if enemies are on high ground or behind treelines or check the Rosh pit.\nYou can cast Sleight of Fist while traveling to a Fire Remnant, but the timing is extremely tight. Not only do you need to target the Sleight of Fist immediately after entering Activate Fire Remnant, but you also need to target the Sleight directly along the path you're flying because Ember Spirit can't turn while flying to a Remnant.\nHonestly, this tip is purely here for the Ember Spirit enthusiasts who are fact checking my site for comprehensiveness. It's utterly useless in 99% of situations and nothing that I just typed makes any sense to a new player trying to learn Ember. But for you, Mr. 2000 Games On Ember? Yeah, I know your tech. Your useless tech.\nNeutral tokens won't drop from creeps if you're in Sleight of Fist or traveling in Fire Remnants. So if you haven't gotten all your neutral tokens yet, avoid last hitting with those spells, otherwise the creeps will have a zero percent chance of dropping a neutral item.\nSleight of Fist won't draw aggro from neutrals because they don't know who hit them.\nRaindrops absorb damage before Flame Guard does. If you're trying to preserve your Flame Guard in lane for damage or to help last hit, a Raindrop may buy you some more damage to tank.\nYour Remnants' travel speed scales off your hero's move speed when cast. This means that you should avoid casting fresh Remnants when you're slowed.\nThis is relevant when dealing with weird spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field and Slark's Pounce. If you walk to the very edge of these spells then your move speed is considered zero and your Remnant won't go anywhere.\nYou can pick up items, such as Aegis or runes, while traveling to a Remnant or when flying around in a Sleight of Fist.\nWhen traveling to a Fire Remnant, you deal damage to everything on the way in a melee range radius around your hero.\nUse Remnants for mobility purposes as well as damage. Toss one out before teleporting back to base so you can quickly get back out on the lane. Toss one out before dying so you can get back out on the map as soon as you respawn (or buyback).\nYou consume all placed Remnants when activating one. Ember travels to the Fire Remnant furthest away from the targeted one first.\nEmber Spirit will turn to face wherever you target Activate Fire Remnant regardless of which Remnant you're actually flying to. If you're just trying to mash your way out of a gank, target Activate Fire Remnant directly in front of your hero so you don't suffer through a potentially lethal turn rate.\nAfter you gank a lane, consider hiding a Remnant somewhere nearby for safekeeping before you return to a different part of the map. Another gank opportunity may present itself in the same lane and enemies may not expect it.\nWhen contesting runes, consider sending a Remnant to one rune spot and walking your hero to the other rune spot.\nDamage from multiple Agh's Shard Remnants do not stack.\nWith Agh's Shard, you'll spawn a Remnant wherever you die.\nCounters\nWhenever Ember uses Sleight, he leaves a temporary Remnant behind during the cast. This is where he'll always return once Sleight finishes. Use this as a beacon to set up disables like Dark Willow's Bramble Maze, Jakiro's Ice Path, Mirana's Arrow, or just start mashing your silence/hex/disable on the temporary remnant so you can catch him as soon as he returns.\nEmber hates silences, but he also really hates slows. The travel speed on Remnant casts scale off of Ember's own move speed, so heroes with strong slows can cut Ember's aggression significantly since he'll need to pre-cast an escape Remnant before going in.\nEmber cannot Activate Fire Remnant or cast Sleight of Fist when rooted/leashed.\nEmber consumes all currently spawned Remnants when he Activates one.\nYou can click on Ember and check his buffs to see how many Remnants he currently has out on the map. If he has zero, get ready for the easiest gank of your life.\nSleight of Fist gets affected by evasion, disarms, and damage block.\nYou can dispel Flame Guard. This makes Eul's Scepter and Nullifier solid items to have against Ember.\nEmber can pick up runes while flying around in a Sleight of Fist. Depending on how good of an Ember player you're up against, you should consider stopping for a moment just short of a rune to bait his Sleight so that he can't snatch it from you.\nThe \"Gossamer Cape\" neutral item can be a valuable pickup against Ember Spirit to evade Sleight of Fist attacks."

You can also Smash people out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nThe following interactions are also true with Agh's Shard Geomagnetic Grip working on allies. Except the Chronosphere one. You can't Grip allies out of Chrono.\nIf an enemy is standing on you trying to block your Rolling Boulder escape, use Boulder Smash to boot the enemy away first and then Roll away.\nIf you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" option enabled, you can double tap the Remnant hotkey to automatically drop one in front of yourself.\nYou can drop a Remnant while you're revving up in Rolling Boulder.\nAfter the initial rev up delay, you're fully invulnerable during Rolling Boulder. This means invulnerable to disables (you can roll through an Enigma Black Hole or Faceless Void Chronosphere) and invulnerable to damage (you can roll while Bloodseeker Rupture'd and won't take damage).\nAs mentioned earlier, you can Boulder Smash allies out of Chronosphere. So consider Rolling yourself through a Chrono while invulnerable and booting an ally out to save them.\nIf you Roll over the edges of the map, you briefly get high ground vision over the surrounding treeline. This can be useful to scout out enemies that may be hiding or juking.\nIf you Roll over the edges of the map at an angle, you'll be placed back onto the map without breaking any trees behind you. If you're trying to escape enemies chasing you in the trees, consider doing this instead of bulldozing every tree in a straight line.\nThere is an extremely small window of time in which you can Smash a Remnant that you're about to Roll into and you'll get the full Roll distance while also sending an invisible Smash projectile. Mechanically, think of it like you're consuming the Remnant with your Roll while it's being Smashed away. Outside of team fights, this can also be an efficient way to clear creep waves with a single Remnant.\nYou can use/target spells while Rolling in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.\nYou can use/target items while Rolling in your Boulder (except Blink and TP scrolls). This can be useful for Shiva's, Scythe of Vyse/Orchid, Eul's Scepter, and wards.\nIf you use a Force Staff while Rolling Boulder is revving up, you'll get the Force and continue Rolling starting from your new location. There are multiple applications of this interaction:\nYou can Force Staff yourself to potentially phase through an enemy blocking your Boulder path before you start Rolling.\nYou can immediately turn your hero left or right after starting the Roll and Force Staff yourself to change your starting trajectory.\nHere's a video by Qwerja demonstrating both interactions.\nYou can pick up runes while Rolling.\nWhen you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately kick them back along the path you came.\nNearly all of your spells destroy trees in some way. Useful against heroes like Nature's Prophet or Monkey King.\nNeither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels when directly targeted on the hero.\nReduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.\nThe disadvantage of recycling is that you end up stacking your total disables on top of each other. If you have Remnants to burn, stagger your spells.\nRemember that you can get the Geomagnetic Grip silence from pulling allied creeps too. You don't have to use Remnants to get the silence.\nConsider using Geomagnetic Grip on allied creeps to cliff them. Situationally useful for denying experience to enemies in the early game and useful as cheap wards all game long.\nThe search trigger radius on a Remnant from a Magnetized unit is smaller than the activation/refresh radius to Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to Magnetized enemies.\nRepeatedly Magnetizing an enemy doesn't increase the duration, it just refreshes the debuff. So when trying to maximize damage, wait for the debuff to time out on an enemy before re-Magnetizing them.\nIf any one Magnetized target gets silenced from Grip or slowed by Smash, all other Magnetized targets will receive the same debuff.\nRolling into an Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant will immediately take the hero you Stoned out of Remnant form.\nYou can cast Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant on yourself as Earth Spirit and then use Boulder Smash on yourself.\nAgh's Scepter Enchant Remnant can also be used on Stone Remnants if you want the damage.\nIf you cast Agh's Scepter Enchant Remnant on a debuff immune/BKB'd target, they become untargetable and invulnerable. This is consistent with allies or enemies.\nDebuff immune targets become so untargetable and invulnerable while Enchant Remanant'd that they can even act inside a Faceless Void Chronosphere or Enigma Black Hole.\nIf you Geomagnetic Grip a debuff immune Enchant Remnant'd enemy, it puts the enemy into a persistent flail animation. Completely useless tip, but it is pretty funny.\nYou can cast Enchant Remnant on allied ward units. This is mostly useless because the ward unit dies once Enchant Remnant times out. However, one useful situation is using Enchant Remnant on an allied Phoenix Supernova to protect it. If Supernova ends before Enchant Remnant times out, the Egg will stun. If Enchant Remnant times out before Supernova ends, the Egg will jankily sink into the ground and not stun anything. In both situations, the Egg will be untargetable and Phoenix will respawn as expected.\nCounters\nDuring Rolling Boulder, Earth Spirit can only be touched when he's revving up in place. Once he starts moving, he's completely invulnerable to damage and disables.\nWhen killing an Earth Spirit, stand in front of his Rolling Boulder and make him hit you to prevent him from Rolling out of the situation.\nEarth Spirit cannot cast Rolling Boulder when rooted or leashed.\nEarth Spirit needs a lot of time to recharge Remnants after a team fight. Keep high aggression when playing against an Earth Spirit.\nMagnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and they're not.\nMagnetize can be dispelled."

        "guide": "Tips\nEnemies don't see your Firestorm or Pit of Malice indicators during the cast animation. The only person you're mindgaming is yourself.\nPit of Malice doesn't provide any vision by itself, but you can see its little rooty tendrils shoot up whenever it successfully catches a hero.\nYou can very faintly see some ethereal particles shoot up whenever the Pit roots non-hero units. You can potentially use this on the Rosh pit to check if he's spawned, but it's super difficult to see.\nPit of Malice catches invisible targets and provides true sight on them whenever they're rooted.\nPit of Malice doesn't root the entire AoE at fixed intervals, each unit is independently rooted whenever they walk in or stay in the Pit. So items that keep enemies in the AoE of Pit can be useful to re-root them after the delay.\nYou don't gain Atrophy Aura damage from illusions, ward units, or Undying zombie deaths. Only heroes, creeps, or summons dying give you damage.\nEnemies can see your Fiend's Gate destination on cast on their minimap similar to an Io's Relocate.\nEnemy heroes can travel through your Fiend's Gate if they want to.\nMost summons can pass through a Fiend's Gate except for Brewmaster Brewlings and dominated/Enchantress/Chen creeps.\nFiend's Gate destroys trees around both portal locations. You can theoretically use this to globally break trees that a Monkey King is Tree Dancing on or to free allies from a Hoodwink Bushwhack tree. You can't directly target Fiend's Gate onto a tree, but the tree breaking AoE is pretty large.\nIf allies are at the edge of an enemy Disruptor's Kinetic Field, place a Fiend's Gate next to them. While channeling the Gate, they'll slightly move towards it and, in the process, break out of the Kinetic Field. They don't even have to finish the Gate channel, they can just walk away.\nIf a hero has cast range buffs, they can start channeling Fiend's Gate from further away.\nTargets cannot travel through Fiend's Gate while rooted/leashed.\nCounters\nPit of Malice will root you even when you're invis or smoked.\nAtrophy Aura reduces base attack damage, but not raw (+green) damage items or talents.\nBreak disables Atrophy Aura's damage reduction.\nIllusions of Underlord will carry their own Atrophy Aura. Shadow Demon, Terrorblade, and Dark Seer can take advantage of this.\nYou can travel through an enemy Underlord's Fiend's Gate.\nTargets cannot travel through Fiend's Gate while rooted/leashed."

This works with Conjure Image and Manta Style illusions.\nEach Conjure Image cast spawns the illusion in a counterclockwise fashion around your hero. The first cast is north of your hero, the next cast will spawn west of your hero, then south, then east, and repeat. Not particularly useful, but it is cool trivia.\nSunder can be cast on allies and illusions (like Conjure Image or Manta Style illusions).\nSunder has a minimum HP transfer percentage. If you and a target are both under the percentage, Sunder will heal you both to the minimum.\nYou can Sunder through Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast to gain HP. You can Sunder a Borrowed Time Abaddon to make him lose HP.\nYou can't Sunder debuff immune/BKB'd enemies or allies.\nInfused Raindrops are amazing on TB. He has tons of armor, but is very susceptible to magic damage nukes. The mana regen from the item is just gravy.\nThere is a brief delay when activating Agh's Scepter Terror Wave before the fear actually goes out.\nAgh's Scepter Terror Wave will follow your hero as you move similar to a Shiva's Guard active.\nCounters\nThe Reflection slow and illusion can be removed with basic dispels.\nReflection illusions carry all things that normal illusions carry. This includes item auras, so be wary about building things like Radiance or Assault Cuirass against a TB.\nTB has armor for days, but very little HP to back it up. Magic damage makes life for TB and his illusions hell. If your team is mostly physical damage, consider building Maelstrom or Shiva's (yeah I know I just told you not to build auras, but Shiva's is usually worth it) to clear his illusions.\nSunder. It's a spell. One that you should be acutely aware of when trying to kill him.\nAny level of Dagon can instakill illusions. As do spells like Pugna's Life Drain, Lion's Mana Drain, Disruptor's Glimpse, Pudge's Meat Hook, Dazzle's Agh's Shard Poison Touch, and any Hex.\nOther heroes with spells that are useful against illusions include Legion Commander with Overwhelming Odds or Brewmaster's Storm Brewling with Dispel Magic.\nIllusions your team creates of an enemy Terrorblade will spawn in Metamorphosis form if the hero himself has it activated, but they won't transform if TB activates Meta afterwards. The transformation only works on illusions Terrorblade owns.\nIf you're a carry, consider buying a Revenant's Brooch to bypass Terrorblade's extremely high armor in the late game.\nThe Agh's Scepter Terror Wave fear can be dispelled by basic dispels."

        "name": "Phoenix",
        "guide": "Tips\nPhoenix always Icarus Dives clockwise.\nIcarus Dive applies a slow on enemies. Don't just use it as a gap closer and cancel before you land on an enemy, bathe them in the fire debuff first.\nYou can pick things up mid-Dive. You can use this to snatch runes and carry on with your business. To time it properly, just cast the Dive at the X:00 mark. To position it properly, just hover over the spell and you can see the green circle cast range.\nYou can begin channeling an Outpost, Lotus Pool, or Watcher mid-Dive. Just be aware that if you cancel the Dive, you cancel the channel. So ideally you want to start the channeling from the tip of your Dive.\nYou can cast spells and items while flying in Icarus Dive. This is important when trying to catch enemies, lay some damage on them with items or Fire Spirits, and then safely retreat in the Dive.\nShiva's Guard takes a little longer than ~2 seconds to fully expand and will affect any units it makes contact with while expanding. Don't jump into an Icarus Dive the moment you cast it or you'll waste a ton of the Arctic Blast radius.\nYou can begin channeling a TP while Diving, but canceling the Dive will cancel the TP.\nYou can begin channeling a Meteor Hammer mid-Dive.\nDon't rapid fire your Fire Spirits on single targets. The debuff lasts for a few seconds and the damage from multiple Spirits do not stack, they just refresh the debuff. Enemies are much more wary of a Phoenix who still has a Spirit circling around them. Space out Launches, even if you don't land them.\nFire Spirits briefly provide ground vision wherever they land. Useful for scouting Rosh or counterwarding cliffs.\nSun Ray provides vision over the 'projectile,' allowing you to check the Rosh pit or scout in trees with the beam of fire.\nSun Ray does not work on Rosh.\nYou can cast all your spells while Sun Ray is out.\nIf you have Agh's Shard, always try to cast Sun Ray before activating Supernova. Supernova refreshes cooldowns on cast, not when the spell ends. So if you Sun Ray mid-Supernova, you'll respawn with Sun Ray on cooldown.\nYou can cast items while in Sun Ray. In fact, you don't even have to turn your hero to target items if you cast it during Sun Ray.\nIf you begin channeling a TP while moving in Sun Ray, you will continue moving during the channel. Escape enemies by TPing over cliffs (including the unpathable edges of the map).\nTry to find cliffs to Supernova onto if the positioning is convenient. Not only are you giving your team vision and potentially evading enemy vision, but heroes will also uphill miss while attacking your Egg as well.\nActivating Supernova destroys trees in a huge radius so you can't easily hide the Egg in trees.\nAllies can fog your Supernova Egg with vision blockers like the front of Drow Ranger's Agh's Shard Glacier or Nature's Prophet's Sprout trees.\nSupernova forces the entire map to day time during its duration. It'll even override Night Stalker's Dark Ascension and Luna's Eclipse that typically force night time.\nUnlike most other ward units, Supernova doesn't take damage from towers or even the enemy fountain.\nAllies can deny the Supernova Egg once it's under 50%.\nIf an ally dies in an Agh's Scepter Supernova, it counts as a deny by Phoenix.\nSelf-damage does not proc Aeon Disk, so you don't have to worry about popping your own Disk from casting any of your spells.\nCounters\nIcarus Dive can be canceled with stuns, cyclones, hexes, sleeps, fears, and spells/items causing forced movement. Phoenixes will often pull some downright stupid Dives because they assume they'll be able to complete the full cycle. If you see a Phoenix staring at you from afar, keep your trigger finger ready on a stun to cancel the Dive. This is especially important with instant disables like hexes or Eulses or Force Staffs or Harpoons.\nPhoenix cannot cast Icarus Dive when rooted, but roots won't cancel a Icarus Dive in progress.\nStunning, silencing, sleeping, cycloning, fearing, or hexing Phoenix during Sun Ray will cancel the spell.\nNyx Assassin is good at countering Sun Ray since he can just walk into it with Carapace and stun Phoenix ezpz.\nThere are a lot of variables deciding this, but a good rule of thumb to follow is that you'll need 2 heroes to kill a level 1 Supernova Egg and 3 heroes to kill a level 2 Supernova Egg assuming you're all Fire Spirited right before Supernova is cast.\nHeroes that buff attack speed (like Beastmaster with Inner Beast or Ogre Magi with Bloodlust) or items that buff attack speed (Drum, Assault Cuirass) will help a lot with killing Supernovas.\nSnapfire's Lil' Shredder is a great at making an omelette out of the Supernova.\nYou can kill the Egg during Naga Siren's Song of the Siren sleep.\nJuggernaut can damage the Egg while right-clicking during Blade Fury.\nSilencer can be really irritating for a Phoenix to deal with in lane because if you're Last Worded, you can't cancel your Icarus Dive.\nClones like Meepo and Arc Warden's Tempest Double count as heroes when attacking the Egg. Illusions do not and will deal no damage to a Supernova."

        "name": "Oracle",
        "guide": "Tips\nFortune's End is one of the few cheap offensive dispels in the game, so here are some buffs worth noting that can be dispelled off enemies: Abaddon's Aphotic Shield, Dark Seer's Surge and Ion Shell, Ember Spirit's Flame Guard, Magnus's Empower, Monkey King's Jingu Mastery, Ursa's Overpower, Ghost Scepter, Crimson Guard's active, and Haste/Amplify Damage/Arcane/Regen/Shield (but not Invis) runes.\nFortune's End also serves as a basic dispel when cast on allies. This allows you to remove most silences, slows, fears, roots, and other non-stun debuffs like Bounty Hunter's Track off allies.\nEvery enemy in the AoE of the Fortune's End projectile gets damaged, dispelled, and rooted upon landing.\nHowever, only an ally directly targeted by Fortune's End gets dispelled, not all allies in the AoE.\nFortune's End can dispel debuff immune enemies, but only if they're hit by the Fortune's End as a secondary target. So if you target an ally/enemy next to a BKB'd enemy, you'll remove buffs off the debuff immune enemy. This is almost certainly a bug, but it does work.\nFortune's End provides true sight on only the primary target during the root duration.\nYou can be cute and pre-channel Fortune's End on an ally who's about to Blink or TP somewhere. If they run into an enemy, you may catch someone in the root/dispel AoE from downtown.\nYou can self-target Fortune's End. If an enemy is closing in on you, or you can't target an enemy, start channeling it on yourself to discourage the enemy from getting within melee range of you.\nPre-targeting Fortune's End can also be useful to outplay silences. If you are about to enter a team fight and you think an enemy Silencer may use Global Silence, start channeling Fortune's End on yourself to automatically dispel off the silence when it cancels your channel.\nPre-targeting Fortune's End can also be useful to outplay cyclones. If an Invoker or some Eul's hero is chasing you, start casting Fortune's End on yourself and let them \"catch\" you. You'll immediately dispel the cyclone once it hits you and cancels your channel.\nThe damage on Fortune's End does not scale the longer you channel it, only the root duration scales.\nYou can target Fortune's End on allied couriers.\nBecause Fortune's End provides vision, you can target your courier with the spell and send it into the Rosh pit to scout with the projectile.\nIf you want to easily make sure the Purifying Flames heal gets dispelled off an enemy, just cancel Fortune's End's channel by casting Purifying Flames on your target. This won't work if your target is less than 350 distance away from you since the Fortune's End projectile will land before you complete the Purifying Flames cast animation.\nYou can target Fortune's End on any cycloned target from an enemy Eul's (or Invoker Tornado or Brewmaster Storm Brewling Cyclone) to dispel the cyclone. Cyclones from allied Eul's (including your own) cannot be dispelled, but you can still target and channel the Fortune's End on the cycloned target.\nFate's Edict can disarm Rosh.\nFate's Edict and Purifying Flames both work on enemy, allied, and neutral creeps.\nThis is core knowledge for playing Oracle: Cast Fate's Edict first on an ally before Flaming them. They'll be immune to hurt feelings the nuke damage, but still get the heal.\nYou can cast Glimmer Cape on allies before Flaming them and the barrier will block the nuke damage.\nIf you have a Spirit Vessel charge placed on an enemy target, Purifying Flame to your heart's content. The heal will be heavily reduced so you don't really have to worry about it canceling out the nuke damage.\nPurifying Flames has a few noteworthy interactions with how it damages allies:\nPurifying Flames damage can break Salves/Clarities/Urn on allies, but not on yourself.\nPurifying Flames damage can trigger an ally's Aeon Disk, but never your own.\nThe damage on Purifying Flames allows you to wake allies sleeping under Elder Titan's Echo Stomp or Bane's Nightmare.\nThe damage on Purifying Flames allows you to build Uproar stacks on an ally Primal Beast.\nThe damage on Purifying Flames can proc an ally Bristleback's passive Quill Spray.\nThe damage on Purifying Flames will break ally Blink Daggers.\nPurifying Flames will never deal lethal damage to allied units.\nYou can get ninja denies on your creeps by Purifying them and then immediately going for deny attacks to finish them off. Or if a creep is already below 50%, toss a right click and then cast Purifying Flames while your attack projectile is flying.\nFalse Promise is a strong dispel. You can cast it on allies to wipe off any disable, including stuns.\nIf things are getting chaotic in a fight, know that you can target spells on allies like False Promise by clicking on the allied hero's portrait in the top bar.\nYou can False Promise creep-hero units like Warlock's Golem or Lone Druid's Spirit Bear.\nThe globe effect above a False Promised hero is supposed to indicate the current state of damage. A fiery red orb means they've probably taken more damage than healing, but it's not very consistent.\nA False Promised hero can never have their Blink Dagger be broken because they can't take 'damage' during False Promise.\nHealing Salves, Bottle, and Urn/Spirit Vessel heals can't be broken by damage on a hero that's False Promised, but an enemy can take them off with dispels.\nBe proactive about gathering Healing Lotuses and casting them on allies who are False Promised.\nThe only ways of cheating a False Promise death are with Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Abaddon's Borrowed Time, or Troll Warlord's Battle Trance.\nYou can theoretically dodge a False Promise death with Aeon Disk, but it's dependent on a bunch of different factors and not really consistently exploitable.\nAll the math regarding heals and damage received under False Promise is calculated at the end of the spell. So debuffs that interfere with HP regen, like an enemy Spirit Vessel or Ancient Apparition's Ice Blast, only matter if they're still applied by the time False Promise ends.\nCounters\nWhen trying to counter healing from False Promise, be aware that all the heals are calculated at the end of the buff. So if you're applying a HP manipulation debuff, it has to be active as False Promise ends, not during the False Promise.\nSpirit Vesseling a False Promised target right before the ult ends will reduce their potential regen. Time it close enough so Oracle can't dispel it off with Fortune's End. Skadi and Shiva's also reduce HP regen.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast completely prevents health restoration. Ice Blast can even kill an enemy through False Promise if they were already below the Shatter HP threshold.\nDoom's Doom prevents all heals.\nShadow Demon Demonic Purging a False Promised target makes it difficult for Oracle to save them since most heals he'll pour into his ally will get insta-dispelled.\nCasting Nullifier on a False Promised target will make it very hard for Oracle to heal them because of the constant dispelling.\nCasting Eul's on a False Promised target can help dispel a bunch of stacks of Purifying Flame heals.\nAxe's Culling Blade can kill through False Promise."

        "name": "Winter Wyvern",
        "guide": "Tips\nArctic Burn's DoT can only be applied once per enemy per cast and multiple attacks on the same target do not refresh the debuff. Spread your damage out between enemies when in Arctic Burn and pay attention to the buff timer in your status bar to maximize your damage.\nWith Agh's Scepter, multiple Arctic Burn attacks on the same hero do refresh the debuff.\nArctic Burn's DoT deals a percentage of the target's current HP as magic damage. Your ideal targets are heroes who have the highest current HP, not max HP.\nAs a result, the DoT can never kill an enemy. Some asymptotic damage up in this bitch.\nWhen in Arctic Burn, Winter Wyvern can't uphill miss on units or structures. Because she's flying. A rare instance of Dota following logic.\nRespect the buffed night vision when in Arctic Burn. You don't get flying vision, but you can use the bonus sight to scout very well if you travel onto a cliff.\nThe primary target of Splinter Blast does not take damage. I know you're really angry that QoP just Blinked away with 20 HP, but Splinter Blasting her does absolutely nothing. You're better off holding on to the cooldown in case the enemy walks into a creepwave or near some neutrals.\nHaving said that, Splinter Blast is actually a dope Linken's popper because the range is ludicrous.\nSplinter Blast's secondary projectiles can hit invis and fogged units.\nCold Embrace the creep that's tanking tower shots when pushing; ideally when they're almost dead so they'll heal too.\nCold Embrace protects units from all physical damage, including damage from spells like Death Prophet's Exorcism or Bristleback's Quill Spray.\nWinter's Curse provides true sight on the primary target.\nWinter's Curse applies a dispel on the primary target on cast. This is a rare example of a dispel that can pierce debuff immunity/BKB.\nDebuff immune enemies can be Winter's Cursed if they're the primary target. However, debuff immune enemies will not be taunted into attacking an ally who's Cursed.\nWinter's Curse taunts in the AoE for the full duration of the spell and is sticky on the Cursed unit. You can Force Staff a Cursed enemy to catch fresh enemies or to drag taunted enemies deeper into your territory.\nWinter's Curse lasts for a shortened duration if there are no targets taunted into attacking the primary Cursed enemy.\nNeutral creeps don't get taunted into attacking a Winter's Cursed enemy, but if they're in the AoE of the spell, you'll get the full Curse duration. Roshan and Tormentors count as a neutrals.\nWinter's Curse can be cast on all enemy units, including creeps or summons. The situations in which this could be useful are far and few between, but you could use this to catch enemies who play it fast and loose with Blink Daggers (like Puck or Tinker) by Cursing a creep that's close to where the enemy will be. Or use it to bypass a Linken's Sphere if you just need a quick disable.\nCasting Winter's Curse on neutral creeps won't taunt enemies. You'll just force some neutrals to murder one of their kin for no reason.\nWinter's Curse can be cast on Roshan and Tormentors, but as with other neutrals it won't taunt any enemies. It does make the target only damageable by Wyvern, though.\nWyvern and any units she owns can damage Winter's Cursed enemies but only with magical or pure damage. Physical damage, like from attacks, won't damage Cursed enemies.\nI guess technically your attacks can go through if you're using Revenant's Brooch.\nAllies cannot damage any enemies under Winter's Curse. Neither primary nor secondary Cursed targets.\nHowever, allies can still apply debuffs to Cursed enemies. Like stun/silence them, or apply DoTs, or build passive stacks (Ursa Fury Swipes, Monkey King Jingu Mastery, etc), or burn their mana.\nYour team can damage an enemy under Winter's Curse (for a percentage of damage) if the target is affected by Undying's Flesh Golem damage amplification attack debuff.\nMost item/spell passives and attack modifiers are coded to not work on allies, so don't rely on an enemy critting or mana burning an ally under Curse to get a kill. There are a few exceptions: Slark's Essence Shift, Sniper's Headshot, and Basher/Abyssal bashes will work on allies.\nMuerta's Gunslinger technically works on allies but only if there are no other targets for her to Gunsling onto. If any other target is nearby, she'll start Slinging onto it instead of the Cursed target.\nBe sure to apply damage to any slippery targets in the Curse with a Splinter Blast before the Curse ends to make sure they don't Blink out. Remember, only you can deal damage to the Cursed targets, not your allies.\nCounters\nCold Embrace allows for a lot of easy setups for delayed/skillshot spells. Dumb Wyverns will often Embrace allies when they're in clear vision, so try to take advantage of the situation.\nRevenant's Brooch turns right clicks into magic damage allowing you to penetrate Cold Embrace.\nYou can continue building 'stacks' on an Embraced enemy with spells like Slark's Essence Shift, Bristleback's Quill Spray, Ursa's Fury Swipes, etc.\nDon't walk into a Cursed ally. Think of the big snowflakey area like a Chronosphere because you will get sucked into fighting your teammate.\nEthereal Blade or Wind Waker can be used to protect a Cursed target from getting right clicked to death by allies.\nPugna's Decrepify could also work."

        "name": "Arc Warden",
        "guide": "Tips\nArc Warden and his Tempest Double have inverse spells depending on if you're playing the hero on Radiant or Dire. For consistency, I will be referring to Radiant Arc Warden's spells as the \"Arc Version\" and Dire Arc Warden's spells as the \"Tempest Version.\"\nMultiple Flux casts on the same target fully stack.\nManipulate creep aggro to get good Fluxes in lane. The search radius for muting Flux is basically melee range, so right click an enemy hero to attract their creeps towards you, then Flux 'em. Just don't forget to kill their ranged creep first.\nThe Tempest Version of Magnetic Field provides base bonus attack damage and bonus attack range for ranged allies. The bonuses work on all allied heroes, creep-heroes, buildings, and illusions. All illusions, even your teammate's Phantom Lancer illusions will hit harder under the Tempest Magnetic Field.\nBoth versions of Magnetic Field work fully on towers.\nYou don't need to fully envelope a tower in Magnetic Field to give it the bonuses. For the Arc Version, place the bubble in a way that just barely skims the back of the tower so enemies can't easily stand in it and bypass the evasion. The easiest way to estimate the distance is to left click on the tower, look at the green selection circle on the ground, and cast Magnetic Field so that it barely touches the circle.\nThe Tempest Version of Magnetic Field gives towers extra attack range and damage. It can be worth using this on your towers before activating a Glyph.\nSpark Wraiths trigger on invisible and Smoked units.\nSpark Wraiths provide a small radius of ground vision wherever they're planted.\nUse Spark Wraiths to stack neutral camps.\nYou can double tap Tempest Double to cast it next to your hero.\nThe gold/experience bounty on the Tempest Double is significant, so avoid feeding it to enemies.\nThe Tempest Double can pick up and use any rune except Wisdom runes.\nThe Tempest Double can channel Outposts, Watchers, and Lotus Pools.\nInteractions with various items on the Double:\nDoubles cannot duplicate any consumable item (including Bottle).\nItems with charges (Urn, Drum, Holy Locket, etc) copy the Original's charges.\nMidas is considered core since the item effectively has a 2x multiplier with the Tempest Double.\nThe Tempest Double's item cooldowns operate independently of your own.\nDoubles cannot copy Aegis, Gem, or Rapier. It can copy Refresher, but it can't activate it.\nA Double's BKB time decrements on its own.\nDoubles cannot pick up or drop items. You also cannot move items around in the Double's inventory/backpack.\nAny neutral item that has a right click effect with a cooldown won't apply with the Tempest Double.\nSo what can you do with items?\nTwo Shivas' can be a double magic nuke in a huge radius. The active's slow and passive aura don't stack, however.\nYou or your Tempest Double can Eul's Scepter each other. Yeah, no need for Wind Waker, just Eul's.\nPipe of Insight's active does not have a stack limit duration, unlike Mek or Greaves. Multiple Pipe activations don't stack a bigger barrier, though, it'll just reset the barrier value to max. That being said, you probably shouldn't build Pipe on Arc unless you're against some kinda Zeus, Sand King, Leshrac, Queen of Pain, Tinker team or something.\nA double Dagon 5 can deal a ton of magic damage very quickly. This build can also be ruined by someone just building BKB or Aeon Disk.\nTempest Doubles copy the Moon Shard buff if the main hero has one consumed.\nConsider enabling the console command dota_player_smart_multiunit_cast true if you're playing Arc Warden or Meepo. This command makes the game attempt to cast a targeted spell on the first unit selected that doesn't have the spell on cooldown without you tabbing through control groups.\nHere's an example: You have both your hero and your Tempest Double selected. You cast Magnetic Field from your hero and put the spell on cooldown. You can press the spell hotkey again and the game will attempt to cast the spell, skip your hero because it's on cooldown, and then make the Double cast Magnetic Field.\nCounters\nFlux won't deal damage if you're standing near any allied unit.\nFlux can also be muted by standing next to neutral creeps. Unfortunately, couriers do not mute Flux.\nArc Warden has no stuns. If you think you can't survive a surprise Flux gank, just TP out.\nIn team fights, positioning items like Blink or Shadow Blade can help you isolate the real Arc Warden before he gets the opportunity to lay down a bunch of spells.\nThe Double cannot duplicate any sources of true sight, so invisibility like from Shadow Amulet/Shadow Blade/Glimmer Cape can be invaluable for survival.\nCertain abilities can instakill creeps even if they're Glyphed. These include: Doom's Devour, Mirana's Sacred Arrow, Night Stalker's Agh's Shard Hunter in the Night, Pudge's Meat Hook, Hand of Midas, and Dagon. These can be handy to remember in a late game situation if Arc Warden Glyphs a creep wave while traveling on to it.\nAccuracy does not affect attacks on structures, so MKB or true strike won't help you hit buildings under Magnetic Field.\nThe yellow Magnetic Field (Arc Version) won't provide any evasion to enemy heroes or buildings if you're attacking while inside the Field.\nSpark Wraiths cannot be disjointed. Think of it like Skywrath Mage's Arcane Bolt since it also provides vision as it travels towards you.\nKill the Double. This is easier said than done in the late game, but it's worth having your team cooperate to slaughter the Tempest since the bounty on it is significant.\nMost spells treat the Double like a hero, not like an illusion.\nSpells that give temporary buffs when attacking heroes will proc on the Tempest Double. Examples: Bounty Hunter's Jinada gold steal, Monkey King's Jingu Mastery stacks, Outworld Destroyer's Astral Imprisonment mana steal, Silencer's Glaive INT steal, and Slark's Essence Shift temporary stat steal.\nSpells that give permanent buffs when killing a hero will not proc when killing the Tempest Double. Examples: Axe's Culling Blade, Legion Commander's Duel, Lion's Finger of Death, Necrophos's Reaper's Scythe, or Bounty Hunter's Track. However, Axe's Culling Blade still resets its cooldown when killing the Double as if it's a hero, it just won't give the kill stacks.\nPhantom Lancer makes life difficult for Arc Warden. Illusions and dispels make Flux useless, evasion from the Arc Version Magnetic Field can be easily bypassed by Phantom Rush, and Arc Warden isn't great at dealing AoE damage.\nIf Disruptor Glimpses a freshly spawned Tempest Double, it'll immediately get sent back to Arc Warden's fountain since it was \"dead\" there."

    {
        "name": "Monkey King",
        "guide": "Tips\nBoundless Strike's damage is applied as an instant attack. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers (except cleave). If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on each target hit.\nSince Boundless Strike is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.\nIf you Boundless Strike Mud Golems to death, the Shard Golems will also get hit by the Boundless Strike as they spawn. Small farming efficiency note.\nAll on-hit effects can proc from Boundless Strike except for cleave. This includes adding or consuming Jingu Mastery stacks.\nNo matter how many targets are hit in Boundless Strike, only one Jingu Mastery stack is consumed. If you're low on HP and have Jingu active, try saving Boundless to smack an entire creep wave and lifesteal off every target.\nIf you save your first skill point in Tree Dance, you can skill it up and immediately cast it after taking damage since the damage cooldown is only in effect after the spell is learned.\nYou can't place Jingu stacks on illusions. An optimist sees this as a way to identify the real Phantom Lancer with a Boundless Strike, a pessimist would be angry they can't tap that unattended Terrorblade illusion for a free Jingu.\nYou're considered two 'levels' of high ground elevation up when perched during Tree Dance, but enemy units will have vision of you at their ground level whenever you're jumping from tree to tree.\nGround targeted spells will affect you normally when you're on a tree and you can still detonate Techies Proximity Mines while jumping or sitting on a tree.\nCasting Boundless Strike or Mischief won't unperch you from a tree, but finishing a Wukong's Command cast will. You can use items, like TP, without getting unperched.\nThe enemy will hear your Primal Spring channeling sound at wherever the landing is targeted.\nDon't attempt to Primal Spring through Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Mars's Arena. You'll get stuck on the edge and won't be able to act until their spell ends and your Spring finally finishes traveling.\nHere are a few Mischief interactions:\nWhen in Mischief, you won't appear on the enemy minimap at all. Handy for courier sniping or sneaking through warded areas. You could even theoretically walk all the way to the enemy ancient and slap any couriers that are hanging out outside the fountain.\nEnemy towers and creeps won't attack you when you're in Mischief.\nThe first 0.2s of Mischief provides damage immunity from any source. You can't disjoint projectiles and it's not a banish, but you can prevent taking damage from any incoming projectiles/attacks/damage over time ticks for that period. This includes immunity to damage from allies, like an Oracle's Purifying Flames.\nYou can instantly drop aggro from creeps by going into Mischief.\nRight clicking heroes while in Mischief won't draw aggro from creeps, but creeps will aggro you as soon as you start your attack.\nActivating Mischief in most situations will turn you into a Courier, Iron Branch, Clarity, Salve, TP Scroll, Tango, or a banana.\nIf you're standing next to a non-hero unit, like a lane/neutral creep or summoned unit (excluding creep-heroes), you'll turn into that unit.\nOther transformations are location dependent. Standing near a tree will make you a tree. Rosh pit will make you an Aegis, Cheese, Refresher Shard, or Roshan himself. Near a Tormentor will turn you into the blue (Radiant) Tormentor. Rune spot will make you a bounty or power rune depending on location.\nThe enemy can't see the Jingu Mastery buff over your head when you're in Mischief, but debuffs (like Dust or Ursa's Fury Swipes) will still show above your disguise.\nYou can theoretically cram yourself into various armpits around the river to hide yourself as a banana. Too bad I'm not about to test this on every graphics setting on every different terrain to see how viable this is, so just assume it's useless.\nMechanically, Wukong's Command soldiers have your right click plus whatever items you have.\nWukong's Command soldiers can't proc Basher/Abyssal or Echo Sabre, but they can proc every other on-hit item effect. They also individually carry whatever auras your hero has, including Radiance.\nAs for neutral items, any item that has a right click effect with a cooldown won't apply with Wukong soldiers.\nAgh's Scepter soldiers won't attack buildings unless the real Monkey King is within 500 range of them.\nAgh's Scepter soldiers will disappear when you die, even if you have an Aegis.\nCounters\nTree Dance follows Blink Dagger rules in terms of going on cooldown when damaged, so DoT spells or things like Urn help make Monkey King a little less slippery.\nDestroying the tree Monkey King is perched on will stun him for a hefty period of time. Not many heroes can easily take advantage of this, but: Beastmaster's Wild Axes, Windranger's Powershot, Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning, Phoenix's Icarus Dive and Supernova, Enigma's Midnight Pulse, Keeper of the Light's Agh's Scepter Will-O-Wisp, Mars's Arena of Blood, Underlord's Fiend's Gate, Timbersaw's everything, Earth Spirit's everything, or Batrider's Firefly are a few examples of spells that are either fast enough or large enough to catch a Tree Dancing Monkey King by surprise.\nDon't forget about the tree cutting capabilities of Quelling Blade or Battle Fury late game. Force Staff can also break trees.\nThis is probably useless information, but Quelling Blade's active doesn't share a cooldown with Battle Fury allowing you to cut double the trees! The passive Quell bonus damage from both items also stack...\nRoshan's Banner is a global instant cast item that destroys trees in a fairly large AoE. In a late game situation, it could be worth sitting on the Banner in your inventory to stun a Tree Dancing Monkey King.\nThe \"Light Collector\" neutral item's active can destroy trees that a Monkey King may be Dancing on next to you.\nYou'll need vision of him to even know what tree he's on to begin with. Heroes with vision providing spells like Razor's Plasma Field, Disruptor's Thunder Strike, Puck's Illusory Orb, or Drow Ranger's Agh's Shard Glacier can be handy. Shiva's Guard's active also provides a lot of flying vision.\nNature's Prophet's Agh's Shard Curse of the Oldgrowth can easily reveal a nearby Monkey King who's jumping around in trees.\nMonkey's Jingu Mastery damage+lifesteal buff can be removed with basic dispels. This makes heroes like Oracle with Fortune's End or Enchantress with Enchant useful in the laning phase or Shadow Demon with Demonic Purge useful in the late game.\nBreaking Monkey King, like with Viper's Viper Strike or Silver Edge, will prevent him from adding Jingu stacks on targets he hits and stop him from being able to spend any Jingu buffed attacks.\nThe audio cue from Primal Spring is played based on your camera placement. For example, if you hear the guzheng to your left, he targeted the Spring on the left side of whatever your camera's looking at.\nWukong's Command soldiers' right clicks can be reduced by damage block from Vanguard or Crimson Guard.\nYou can try shoving Monkey King out of Wukong's Command with a Force Staff if he's near the edge or use spells that Fear or spells that bounce heroes like Huskar's Inner Fire or Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light.\nGlyphing the creep wave can be an effective way to minimize the amount of lifesteal MK gets from a Boundless Strike if he has Jingu ready."

        "guide": "Tips\nBrambles can trigger on invisible units and provide true sight for the root duration.\nEven though you can't really tell when casting the spell, each Bramble in the Maze spawns in a specific sequence and there is a slight delay between each activation. The order is: inner circle spawns with the right Bramble first, then continues spawning counterclockwise. Then the outer circle spawns from top right Bramble and continues spawning counterclockwise. tl;dr: Inner circle right Bramble spawns the quickest, outer circle bottom right Bramble spawns ~0.7s later.\nActivating items or casting spells won't break Shadow Realm. You can also cast Shadow Realm while channeling a TP.\nShadow Realm will disjoint all incoming projectiles after the fade time. You will also be invulnerable to any instant attacks from spells while in Realm.\nShadow Realm mostly follows the same rules as invisibility for spells that target you.\nThe bonus damage from Shadow Realm doesn't work on buildings or wards, but you can still use the bonus attack range provided by the spell to attack those types of units.\nIf your attack misses, Shadow Realm damage won't land. If you die while the Shadow Realm projectile is flying, the bonus damage won't land.\nCursed Crown draws aggro from creeps. If you're getting chased by a few enemies in the jungle, you can try casting it on a neutral who will start following you and then start following the people chasing you.\nA target becoming banished won't stop the Crown AoE stun from triggering around them.\nJex won't attack any units in fog during Bedlam.\nHowever, Jex does provide a small radius of vision around himself. You can use Bedlam to check cliffs for wards.\nJex's targeting is completely random in Bedlam. No priority is given to heroes, low HP targets, units you're right clicking, or anything. However, you can obviously influence what target is chosen by moving your hero around. You can vaguely see Jex's attack range from the pink aura surrounding him as he flies.\nJex can attack Rosh during Bedlam.\nEven though Jex 'attacks,' they're not actual right clicks, but instead just a bunch of tiny magic damage nukes. This means that you increase Jex's damage with magic amplification, not armor reduction.\nYou can target Bedlam onto creep-heroes (like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem).\nWhen casting Terrorize, you have to compensate for the lengthy cast animation and the time it takes for Jex to fly. Cancel the animation if you look like you're going to whiff it.\nYou can't cast Bedlam if Jex's projectile is still flying to/from a Terrorize cast location. But you can 'catch' Jex by blinking into him to get access to Bedlam quicker.\nTerrorize provides shared vision over all affected units for the duration of the fear and ground vision around where the Terrorize lands. Jex also provides vision as he flies back to you.\nRemember that fears are also silences+mutes during their duration. A Terrorized Morphling can't activate Attribute Shift and a Terrorized Sven can't activate BKB. All they can do is run.\nWhen Terrorized, Rosh just sits in his pit sulking and won't attack anything.\nWhen you Terrorize enemies who have breached your side lane high ground and are attacking your barracks, it's likely that the feared path they'll take will be through your base into the mid lane, rather than down the side lane stairs.\nEnemies can only hear your Terrorize cast animation sound cue if they either have vision of your hero or if they have vision of the point where you're targeting Terrorize. This is can be useful around the Rosh pit as you can surprise enemies by targeting Terrorize on the walls of the pit where they can't hear the cast. If you're getting chased, you can target the Terrorize on a high ground where enemies likely won't have vision as opposed to a low ground where they'll hear the cast. If you're trying to fear a slippery hero like Anti-Mage, try targeting Terrorize in the trees where he may not hear it rather than directly on top of him.\nCounters\nPay attention to your pathing when playing against a Willow. The capture radius on Brambles is tiny. With a little effort, you should be able to sidestep the roots.\nAgainst Willow's Agh's Shard Cursed Crown, you can dodge the generated Brambles pretty easily by right clicking in the diagonal middle between the Brambles first and then pathing out the rest.\nBramble roots, the Cursed Crown countdown debuff, and the Terrorize fear can all be removed with any basic dispel. Lotus Orb can be a handy item to have on your team to help with that.\nOn every bell toll from Cursed Crown you can faintly see some particles indicating the AoE of stun around your hero. Try to avoid catching your teammates in the stun.\nShadow Realm is basically the same thing as Slark's active Shadow Dance for targeting purposes. Ground targeted spells and items still work just fine against her.\nGleipnir can root Dark Willow even when she's untargetable in Shadow Realm.\nBlade Mail can discourage Willow from soloing you with Shadow Realm+Bedlam damage.\nBedlam targets units randomly in the attack AoE, so surrounding yourself with creeps or summons makes it much harder for Willow to damage you."

        "guide": "Tips\nSwashbuckle sets your damage flat and attacks every unit in the AoE multiple times. There are a few interactions to note:\nEven though there are several... swashes? Each target receives their own individual 'attack' per swash strike. A Javelin Piercing one target doesn't mean every target will get Pierced on the same strike.\nEach attack will burn mana with Diffusal Blade.\nCrits are not great because they multiply off of Swashbuckle's damage, not your attack damage.\nBasher gives you a pretty high probability of Bashing a target in Swashbuckle, but only one unit in the AoE can ever get bashed due to Basher's cooldown.\nMaelstrom also has a cooldown, but you can potentially proc it twice in a Swashbuckle.\nQuelling Blade doesn't add damage to creeps in Swashbuckle.\nCleave can take advantage of the individual Swashbuckle attacks since each target will proc its own cleave AoE.\nIf you slide through a target while traveling in Swashbuckle, you have an instance of Swashbuckle damage around your hero. The collision size for this damage instance is tiny, but it gives you another chance to proc a Lucky Shot or item effect.\nSwashbuckle attacks have true strike and works through disarms.\nSince Swashbuckle counts as an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.\nSwashbuckle and Shield Crash's movements are classed as forced movement. You can use them to move up and down cliffs, travel through trees without destroying them, and break out of spells like Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nYou don't always have to Swashbuckle backwards, you know? Sometimes if you're escaping and there's no chance of landing a Swashbuckle hit on a pursuing enemy, you may just be giving away your position by Swashbuckling into their vision.\nEvery time you successfully hit a hero in Shield Crash, the barrier amount increments and the buff is refreshed.\nYour Shield Crash barrier incrementing is a good way to verify if enemies are hiding nearby in fog or invisible.\nShield Crash's barrier buff doesn't factor illusions as valid heroes, but it does factor clones. Like Meepo. Sweet, sweet Meepo.\nBecause barriers prevent your actual HP from being touched, you can use regen like Bottle without it getting broken as long as the barrier is taking the damage. This also prevents your Blink Dagger from getting broken when taking enemy damage.\nYou're disabled during the Shield Crash animation when walking, but you're not disabled during the Shield Crash animation when Rolling. This means that you can cancel a Rolling Shield Crash into Swashbuckle to move your Shield Crash landing AoE.\nEach Agh's Scepter Swashbuckle AoE from Shield Crash slightly overlaps in the corners around your hero. You can potentially deal more damage to a target if you Shield Crash next to them diagonally.\nIf you shift+queue Blink Dagger+Shield Crash during your Rolling Thunder cast animation, you'll blink to the location and Shield Crash vertically in place. However, your Rolling Thunder will not damage or stun enemies until after the Shield Crash cast finishes landing.\nIf you cancel Rolling Thunder in the middle of jumping in Shield Crash, you'll immediately drop down and Shield Crash in place without keeping the Rolling Thunder momentum.\nYou can jump off the edges of the map in Rolling Thunder with Shield Crash. I can really only see this being useful if you want to hide yourself as you TP out if you think the enemy can cancel it.\nShield Crash has a shorter cooldown if cast while in Rolling Thunder.\nYou can even go into Rolling Thunder while Shield Crash is already on cooldown and it'll immediately be reduced.\nThe prior notes also apply to Agh's Shard Roll Up form.\nWhen playing against Rubick, immediately Shield Crash after going into Rolling Thunder. Putting Shield Crash on cooldown is usually worth preventing Rubick from Spell Stealing your ult.\nAll items work while in Rolling Thunder:\nYou can channel a TP while Rolling.\nYou can Blink while Rolling. You'll continue Rolling in the same direction after Blinking.\nYou can Eul's yourself while Rolling to multihit a single enemy without needing to bounce.\nIf you don't press anything except for the Shield Crash hotkey while in the Eul's cyclone, you'll do stationary Shield Crash in-place after landing.\nYou can Harpoon an enemy while Rolling to drag yourself towards them for a stun.\nRolling Thunder can bounce into Lotus Pools, Clockwerk's Power Cogs, Earthshaker's Fissure, Tusk's Ice Shards, and Drow Ranger's Agh's Shard Glacier. You don't bounce off any other structures, like towers, though.\nThe secret shop owners can also be bounced into. The Radiant secret shop owner has a pretty janky hitbox, though.\nIt's impossible to consecutively chain stun an enemy with Rolling Thunder. Even with perfect bounces, they can always get a BKB or instant cast spell off between bumps.\nYou can drive by an Outpost, Lotus Pool, or Watcher and channel it in the middle of Rolling Thunder. Just make sure you're fine with traveling in a straight line for a few seconds because changing your direction will cancel the channel.\nYou can mess with Rolling Thunder's trajectory by repeatedly attempting to enter a Twin Gate or an Underlord's Fiend's Gate.\nRolling Thunder provides debuff immunity and also serves as a basic dispel on cast.\nAgh's Shard Roll Up provides debuff immunity but does not apply a dispel on your hero.\nNormally, roots/leashes prevent you from using your movement spells. However, you can cast Agh's Shard Roll Up through roots/leashes. If the disable does not pierce debuff immunity, then you should be able to Rolling Thunder or Swashbuckle while in Roll Up.\nHitting someone in Chronosphere with Rolling Thunder will damage and bump them away like normal and you'll continue Rolling in place on the edge of the Chrono.\nThe moment you ricochet off a wall, there's an extremely small window of time when you can click in the same direction you were traveling to keep bumping into the same wall. It requires nearly tick perfect timing, but there's no harm in going for it.\nIf you're committed to using this trick, there is a method to consistently pull this off and perma-bounce against a wall. If you have a mouse with a freescrolling wheel, type in your console:\n\n      bind mwheeldown mc_move\n\nAnd enable the \"Quick Move\" option in the settings menu. This will bind the move command to your mousewheel down and makes your hero act whenever a move hotkey is pressed. Now you can spin mousewheel down to issue a million move commands at once which solves the whole 'timing' issue with this trick.\n\"But Tsunami, the 'Auto-repeat Right Mouse' setting already exists!\" Yup and even that doesn't click fast enough to pull this tech off.\nPangolier is the only hero in the game that doesn't have to turn to cast items.\nLucky Shot's debuff works on Rosh.\nCounters\nPangolier can't cast Swashbuckle or Rolling Thunder if he's rooted/leashed.\nThe Shield Crash barrier can be dispelled off Pango.\nLeashes/roots that go through debuff immunity (like Grimstroke's Soulbind) will cause Pango's Rolling Thunder do a burnout and just spin in place.\nStuns that go through debuff immunity won't cancel Rolling Thunder, but Pango will stop moving during the stun.\nThe only exception is Primal Beast's Pulverize. For some reason Pulverize instantly cancels Rolling Thunder.\nBloodseeker's Rupture forces Pangolier to make some tough choices about life while Rolling.\nPango is only debuff immune in Rolling Thunder. He can still be attacked and take damage. Difficult if you're a melee hero, but ranged heroes can still hit him easily.\nIf you're touching a high/low ground cliff, Pango may push you to the other level of terrain with the Rolling Thunder bump. Try hugging a cliff if he's about to run you over to possibly escape the pinball machine."

        "name": "Grimstroke",
        "guide": "Tips\nThe Stroke of Fate projectile actually does shoot out at a slight angle, as the visual suggests. It always starts 120 range to your left, so if you're trying to hit someone close quarters, target accordingly.\nThe Stroke projectile provides a small radius of vision as it travels and 2 seconds of lingering vision where it ends.\nIf you cast Stroke of Fate on your hero's portrait when your hero isn't moving, the projectile will always shoot out 90\u00b0 to your right, but the animation will look like you're shooting it straight. Not really practical, but very annoying for enemies to predict.\nPhantom's Embrace pops Linken's Sphere on cast, not on projectile impact.\nEnemies cannot begin channeling an Outpost or Lotus Pool if they're silenced (like from Phantom's Embrace). If they've already started channeling, however, a silence won't stop them.\nCasting Phantom's Embrace on a siege creep will make it immediately lose interest in the tower it's attacking and start catapulting the Phantom instead.\nEven though enemies can't disjoint Phantom's Embrace, for some reason Grimstroke can disjoint it himself when it's returning. So be sure to retrieve your wife before you Blink if she's flying back, otherwise the cooldown won't refresh.\nWhen entering a Chronosphere the Phantom's Embrace projectile will pause if it's traveling to a target. If it's latched on to someone inside of a Chronosphere, it automatically flies back and applies the nuke damage. Thus, if you catch an enemy facing into a Chrono, but still on the edge where the Phantom can latch it, you can spam the spell on them.\nPhantom's Embrace provides shared vision over the target as it's flying and once the projectile lands. That means fog of war around the hero is revealed during the spell's duration.\nYou can end Ink Swell early by pressing the spell hotkey again.\nInk Swell can be cast on allied creeps and summons. This also includes allied couriers, so you can actually send an Ink Swelled courier in to potentially stun a target from out of nowhere.\nEnemies won't see any visual of the tendrils damaging them if the Ink Swelled target is invisible.\nInk Swell will work normally even if the ally it's on is banished, however none of the particle effects will be visible.\nSoulbind's leash can cancel TPs (and other channels), even through debuff immunity/BKB, but only if the target is actually bound to something else. No bind, no leash, no cancel.\nSoulbind provides shared vision and true sight for all targets that are affected, even if a hero is not linked to anything else.\nSoulbind can target and connect to creep-heroes, like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, and Warlock's Golem.\nSoulbind cannot link a primary target to illusions or invisible heroes.\nAs a result, if an illusion is the primary target, the Soulbind will always select a real hero out of the bunch because it can never link to another illusion.\nThere is a way to get two Agh's Scepter Dark Portrait illusions of the same hero, but the procedure is a little convoluted. You need to target Soulbind on an illusion of a hero and link it to their real hero. Then you need to cast Dark Portrait on the real hero. If you do this in any other order, you won't get two Dark Portraits.\nLinken's Sphere can block Soulbind for the primary target, but Lotus Orb has no effect on Soulbind. Cast it on a Lotus'd target without fear of it being reflected.\nSoulbind is a wacky spell. Mechanically, think of it like you're putting a Lotus Orb on an enemy, except anything that would get reflected will actually be cast again targeting the other bound hero. That being said, here are the answers to a few burning questions you may have always been curious about:\nAxe's Culling Blade will only give your cooldown back if the primary target is successfully Culled.\nChaos Knight's Reality Rift will suck both targets in towards you.\nKunkka's X will connect on both heroes, but casting the Return will only bring back the primary target.\nHuskar will Life Break to the primary target, then immediately to the secondary target after connecting.\nLegion Commander will quite literally 2v1 in a Duel. You'll get Duel damage for each target that dies. If you die, they'll both get damage. If the primary target dies, you'll move on to the secondary target for however much time is left. I have absolutely no clue how the primary target is chosen, I can't find any logic to it.\nNature's Prophet's Wrath of Nature will only double up if you directly cast it on one of the targets, not if you ground target it.\nOracle will start channeling another Fortune's End after the first one connects, but you won't see the channel bar on your HUD and you need to be standing still before the second channel starts.\nPhantom Assassin will end up on the primary target with Phantom Strike.\nPrimal Beast's Pulverize will fully stun both targets, but only the primary target will generate AoE smashing stuns. The secondary target will get teleported in front of Primal when Pulverize ends.\nRiki's Blink Strike will damage both heroes, but he'll end up on the primary target.\nSand King will Burrowstrike and end up at the targeted location, but a second Burrowstrike will be cast from SK's starting point in the direction of the secondary target. If the secondary target is out of range, the stun won't connect. If the primary target is along the same angle, they can get hit twice.\nSniper will target the primary hero with Assassinate and then immediately shoot another projectile at the secondary target once the first connects.\nTiny's Toss doesn't do anything when you're throwing a Soulbound target, but if you Toss something at a bound target, you will attempt another Toss targeting the secondary hero once your first Toss lands. So if you Toss a Soulbound hero on itself, they'll fly up in the air and if you keep standing there, you'll Toss them to the secondary target as soon as they land.\nTusk's Snowball and Walrus Punch only target the primary hero.\nTerrorblade will Sunder the primary target's HP, the primary gets the secondary's HP, and the secondary will get TB's HP.\nVengeful Spirit will Nether Swap to the primary target's location, the primary will move to the secondary, and the secondary will move to Venge.\nWinter Wyvern's Winter's Curse will work on both enemies and their allies will attack whichever hero is closest to them. However, if both Cursed targets are within the AoE of each other's Curse, neither of them will take any damage.\nChanneled spells like Bane's Fiend's Grip and Shadow Shaman's Shackles work as expected. You stay still, both enemies get affected.\nOnly the primary hero gets targeted by Jugg's Omnislash, Morph's Morph, Rubick's Spell Steal, Spirit Breaker's Charge, and Windranger's Focus Fire.\nOnly the secondary hero gets targeted by Spirit Breaker's Nether Strike.\nThe succ spells (Lion's Mana Drain, Pugna's Life Drain, Death Prophet's Spirit Siphon, Razor's Static Link) will work on both targets simultaneously.\nTalents which multiply how many times a spell projectile gets cast work as expected and double.\nAgh's Scepter Dark Portrait illusions are debuff immune.\nDebuff immunity prevents Tormentor damage from reflecting on the target. You can potentially use your debuff immune Dark Portrait to solo a Tormentor.\nCounters\nYou can kill the Phantom's Embrace projectile while it's flying towards its target.\nFor some reason, the Phantom's Embrace projectile can't pass through Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nThe Phantom can't be dispelled, but will instantly die if you become invulnerable (like from a banish, Eul's cyclone, Manta Style activation, or Bane Nightmare).\nThe Phantom will also instantly die if you turn invisible.\nRemember that Grimstroke's Phantom's Embrace cooldown will be refreshed if you don't kill the ghost.\nPhantom's Embrace always has the highest priority for auto-attacking. Just attack+move to get it off if it's too hard to right click its hitbox.\nThe Ink Swell buff can be dispelled off enemies, but it'll still stun and damage the area once dispelled.\nHowever, killing the Ink Swelled target will prevent the stun and damage from going off.\nYou only count as leashed if Soulbind is actually binding you to someone else. If not, you can use movement spells and TPs freely.\nThere are no reliable ways of breaking the Soulbind leash, so please cooperate with your chained ally to move around instead of comically stretching the bind in opposite directions. Think of it like one of those races where both of you have one leg tied together, except your teammate is actually a cat who's freaking out and wants nothing to do with this.\nOkay, I lied. There are a few reliable ways of breaking Soulbind. Earth Spirit can Boulder Smash people out, Huskar can just Life Break out of it, and Tiny can just Toss homies out of the break range.\nYou can also use the movement during a self-cast Wind Waker to break out of the leash.\nIf you're a carry and Grimstroke has made a Agh's Scepter Dark Portrait of you, focus it. It deals more damage than you, but it also dies very quickly. Don't get lazy, kill it immediately."

        "name": "Hoodwink",
        "guide": "Tips\nIf you have Acorn Shot on alt-cast (which can be toggled by right clicking the spell icon, or pressing alt+hotkey, or by holding ctrl+hotkey), it will always use ground targeting instead of unit targeting. Useful if you're trying to plant a tree with Acorn Shot in the middle of a bunch of units.\nYou can bypass an enemy Linken's Sphere or Lotus Orb by having an Acorn bounce into them (either from your tree or from another target).\nAcorn Shot trees give 200 ground vision.\nAcorn Shot can bounce to units in fog and the acorn projectile provides a small radius of vision as it flies.\nSince Acorn Shot behaves as a right click, it'll break your Smoke if you directly target a unit.\nHowever, an attack from an alt-cast tree Acorn Shot will not break your Smoke, even if it hits a unit.\nSince Acorn Shot behaves as a right click, it'll reveal you in fog to enemies if an Acorn hits any enemy unit.\nAcorn Shot bounces can proc any attack modifiers your hero has. They also ignores disarms. However, the shots can high ground miss if you're on a lower terrain than your targets.\nAcorn Shot attacks can be affected by miss chance, but not disarms. The attacks will still land if you're disarmed.\nEven if Acorn Shot attacks miss, the slow still lands.\nAcorn Shot's initial cast range can be increased by attack range bonuses and cast range bonuses.\nThis means the extra range granted by Scurry's active also increases Acorn Shot range.\nSince the tree from Acorn Shot provides collision, you can use it to push yourself out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Slark's Pounce leash. Just cast the Acorn Shot behind your hero, but inside the selection circle. You can also use this to break allies out of those spells. The tree collision could even theoretically push someone out who walked into the very edge of a Faceless Void's Chronosphere.\nIf you target Bushwhack at a distance greater than ~400 range away and cancel the cast backswing, you can shoot an Acorn Shot tree into the very edge of the Bushwhack AoE and beat the net projectile before it lands. The margin is extremely tight, however.\nThe easiest way to reliably pull this off is to observe the Bushwhack AoE as you're casting it and target the Acorn Shot right at the very edge of that AoE closest to your hero.\nAn Acorn Shot tree will never time out if targets are currently Bushwhacked to it.\nBushwhack gives flying vision around its landing location even if it doesn't latch anything.\nBushwhack can connect on fogged enemies, but not invisible enemies.\nBe aware that if allies (or enemies) apply any sort of forced movement to a Bushwhacked target, they'll instantly be freed. So if Queen of Pain Sonic Waves a Bushwhacked Anti-Mage, she better be using it to get the kill.\nIf any fears are applied to a Bushwhacked enemy, they'll just straight up start walking out of your tree stun.\nBe wary of chaining Bushwhack into disables that break trees like Mars's Spear or Rubick's Telekinesis.\nPay attention to your buffs and try to keep Scurry enabled whenever possible. You'll have significantly more survivability if you're hugging trees.\nYour Acorn Shot tree can enable Scurry evasion.\nThe bonus cast range on Scurry works when casting items too. So you can do things like place Observer Wards farther when Scurry is active.\nYou can push yourself down cliffs by letting the active Scurry buff time out in an unpathable location inside trees.\nYou can use the recoil from Sharpshooter to move up and down cliffs to escape. It works while rooted or leashed, allowing you to break out of things like Slark's Pounce or even Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nEnemies can hear you winding Sharpshooter up even through fog.\nSharpshooter gets fully charged even before the countdown hits zero. You can check by either paying attention to your buffs or listening for the 'notching' sound cue.\nSharpshooter ignores illusions and passes straight through them.\nYou are not disabled during the Sharpshooter windup. You can't move or attack, but you can cast all your spells and items.\nYou are limited to targeting spells and items perfectly in the direction you're aiming Sharpshooter. If you target something outside of the angle allowed, nothing will happen until after Sharpshooter ends.\nIf you get silenced while you're in the Sharpshooter windup, you won't be able to cancel the cast early. However, starting a TP channel instantly cancels Sharpshooter. So if you need to end a Sharpshooter early while silenced, target a TP scroll in your Sharpshooter line-of-sight and you'll be able to cancel it.\nNothing can interrupt a Sharpshooter cast except hitting the subspell hotkey or dying. Stuns, silences, banishes, doesn't matter, this squirrel's gonna get her nut.\nActivating Agh's Scepter Decoy is not perfectly seamless. Enemies will briefly see you disappear before the Decoy illusion takes your place.\nAgh's Shard Hunter's Boomerang provides a small radius of vision around the projectile as it flies.\nAgh's Shard Hunter's Boomerang is blocked by Linken's Sphere if it's unit targeted, but not if it's ground targeted.\nCounters\nDestroying the tree that heroes are Bushwhacked to will immediately cancel the stun.\nIf you see a Hoodwink running up to you and there are no trees around, just start spamming your Quelling Blade (if you have one) on the ground near you. If you're fast, you'll likely instantly cut the Acorn Shot tree she makes before you get Bushwhacked to it.\nIn lane, just mash your Quelling Blade off cooldown to constantly cut trees. Hoodwink is much less intimidating if she has nothing to Bushwhack you to or hide in with Scurry.\nThe \"Light Collector\" neutral item's active can destroy trees in an AoE around you to help counter Bushwhack.\nApplying any type of forced movement to a Bushwhacked hero will also free them. Like from a Force Staff or Snapfire's Firesnap Cookie.\nIf a melee hero Lotus Orb reflects Acorn Shot, the reflected shots will only deal damage if the hero is within 350 + melee hero attack range (default 150) of the bounce targets. This is because Acorn Shot considers your hero as launching the bounce attack from their current location and melee heroes aren't allowed to hit targets more than 350 range away.\nNothing can stop Sharpshooter from going off so don't bother wasting spells trying to cancel it. Just try to juke the projectile.\nIf you silence a Hoodwink while she's charging Sharpshooter, she'll be locked in (unless she starts channeling a TP).\nThe Sharpshooter debuff (the slow and the break) can be removed with basic dispels.\nTimbersaw's tendency to destroy all things trees makes it very difficult for Hoodwink to get Bushwhack stuns."

        "name": "Void Spirit",
        "guide": "Tips\nAether Remnant does full damage on creeps. Handy for securing ranged creep last hits.\nAether Remnant's disable is classed as a fear which behaves as a stun and a silence on enemies. For example, Abaddon can't manually activate Borrowed Time if he's disabled by a Remnant.\nAether Remnants provide flying vision over the \"watch range\" and the Remnant itself. Useful for dewarding or finding enemies hiding in trees.\nAether Remnant can drag heroes up and down cliffs.\nAether Remnant pulls invisible and Smoked enemies. If you place Remnants on top of stairs in the late game, you may be able to detect some sneaky enemy movement.\nAether Remnant also provides true sight on targets caught for the pull duration. True sight doesn't work on Smoked enemies, but does work on other invis enemies.\nCasting Aether Remnant on an Aegis reincarnation will instantly stun the enemy when they respawn.\nPlacing a defensive Aether Remnant on top of an important ally during a high ground siege could make it difficult for enemies to initiate on them since the Remnant will instantly catch anyone who may end up Blinking into the AoE.\nIf you're farming in dangerous territory and are worried about getting jumped, set up an Aether Remnant at an angle that won't get triggered by creeps and stand inside it while farming.\nYou can \"chain\" Aether Remnants together and an enemy can't even act inbetween multiple pulls.\nYou can't really hide Aether Remnants in fog or trees. If any part of the pull AoE is in enemy vision, they'll be able to see the entire Remnant.\nThere is logic to how Aether Remnant chooses a target when there are multiple units in its AoE. Whichever target is closest in a perfect 0\u00b0 line from the Remnant, it grabs first. If there are multiple targets that are perfectly lined up, it'll choose the one furthest away from the Remnant. Supposedly this behavior was changed in 7.32, but now the logic seems totally random.\nIf your teammates have a Force Staff, you can try proposing the idea for them to offensively Force Staff an enemy who is caught by your Aether Remnant. You can pull an enemy pretty far out of position between the Remnant pull and a follow-up Force Staff.\nOnly allies can see which Dissimilate portal you're targeting, not enemies. Stop randomly dancing around in the circles, you're not juking anyone.\nThe formation of the Dissimilate portals is determined by putting one portal directly in front of Void Spirit on cast and making the rest fill out the circle.\nYour hero is always 'located' in the center Dissimilate portal until the spell ends. You can use this to grab runes or Aegis while banished in the Dissimilate as long as what you're picking up is near the middle of your center portal.\nUpon exiting a Dissimilate, your hero will always be facing outwards from the portal you chose.\nYou can use Dissimilate to travel up and down cliffs.\nDissimilate just straight up ignores the silence from Silencer's Last Word.\nIf you're getting ganked in lane and need some emergency regen, consider activating a Salve or Bottle right before going into Dissimilate. Your hero will continue healing while banished.\nBarriers, like from Resonant Pulse, will absorb damage before on-damage effects are triggered on your hero. This means that Salves, Clarities, Bottle, Urn, Blink Dagger, and sleeps won't get broken by attacks until the barrier expires.\nResonant Pulse's barrier only absorbs damage from right clicks or instant attacks. This includes attacks from towers. It does not absorb physical damage from spells.\nRecasting Agh's Scepter Resonant Pulse stacks the barrier value and refreshes the buff.\nResonant Pulse counts clones, such as Meepos or Arc Warden's Tempest Double, as heroes when calculating the barrier. Illusions are not counted.\nPay attention to the Resonant Pulse visuals when you're hunting an invisible or fogged enemy. If it connects on a hero, you'll see particles coming from their direction.\nRemember that Aether Remnant can catch and provide true sight on invis enemies, so you can deal a lot of damage to an invisible enemy blindly if you're lucky good.\nAstral Step can deal damage to invisible enemies. You'll even see a 'slash' particle over where you hit them.\nAstral Step deals an instant attack to all targets hit. This instant attack ignores disarms, has true strike, and applies attack modifiers (except cleave). If you have an attack modifier with a proc, it'll roll for a chance to proc on each target hit.\nIf you have Echo Sabre, every unit hit by Astral Step will receive the Echo Sabre slow and Sabre won't even go on cooldown.\nSince Astral Step is an instant attack, it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.\nAstral Step works fully on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nAstral Step can kill enemy couriers.\nMultiple Astral Steps fully stack. If you need the damage, you can quickly use charges to go in and out on an enemy.\nCounters\nFears, like from Aether Remnant, can be removed with basic dispels such as putting a Lotus Orb on an ally.\nThe circles of Dissimilate are accurate to the damage AoEs. If you stand perfectly in the middle of a group of portals, Void Spirit will have to gamble on which one is actually going to hit you.\nYou can remove the Resonant Pulse barrier off Void Spirit with basic dispels.\nVoid Spirit cannot cast Dissimilate or Astral Step while rooted/leashed.\nDispelling the Astral Step debuff off your hero will just make the delayed damage trigger immediately."

        "guide": "Tips\nFiresnap Cookie can't target allies who are channeling spells or items. The Cookie also has no effect on banished allies.\nAllies can't disjoint the Firesnap Cookie if they blink, it'll follow them everywhere. Grandma's gotta feed you.\nCasting Firesnap Cookie on allies will interrupt any cast animations they're in the middle of.\nFiresnap Cookie's bounce allows targets to pass over cliffs.\nFiresnap Cookie will move allies even if they're rooted.\nCookie can technically move allies who are leashed, but it won't move them beyond the limits of the leash to break it (like from Slark's Pounce or Grimstroke's Soulbind). It also cannot free allies from an enemy Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nFiresnap Cookie does nothing when cast on an ally in Enigma's Black Hole or Faceless Void's Chronosphere, it just wastes the cooldown.\nIf an ally gets affected by forced movement mid-Cookie jump, they'll immediately drop straight down and stun the area underneath their hero. Theoretically, you could Force Staff an ally right after they start bouncing from the Cookie to instantly proc the stun.\nIf a target dies mid-Cookie jump, their corpse will also drop down immediately and stun the ground.\nFiresnap Cookie destroys trees in a small radius around the target's landing location.\nConsider tossing Firesnap Cookie on creeps to get stuns on enemy heroes. Creeps have more predictable pathing than your allied heroes do and enemies may not think to retreat from a creep wave.\nLil' Shredder attacks can apply any attack modifiers your hero has.\nEach Lil' Shredder attack counts as a hero attack against ward units. This is very useful against heroes like Phoenix with Supernova, Shadow Shaman with Serpent Wards, Undying with Tombstone, Pugna with Nether Ward, or Zeus with Nimbus.\nEach Lil' Shredder attack refreshes the armor reduction debuff on a target. You can minmax this by delaying using your last Shredder attack to extend the minus armor debuff on a target for as long as possible.\nMortimer Kisses projectiles give vision as they fly and lingering vision wherever they land.\nYou can cancel Mortimer Kisses early by issuing a stop command.\nCasting any items during Mortimer Kisses will cancel the spell.\nIf you Agh's Scepter Gobble Up a Pangolier in Rolling Thunder, he'll stun everything on the way to the target location.\nYou can Agh's Scepter Gobble Up enemy or neutral creeps, including enemy summons (but not creep-heroes). However, Spit Out counts as a deny, so you don't get any gold bounty from Gobbling units.\nThe cast range on Agh's Scepter Spit Out is the same as the cast range on Mortimer Kisses.\nRespect the z-axis when casting Agh's Scepter Spit Out. If your Spit trajectory sends a hero over a cliff, they may end up landing on the cliff instead of the targeted AoE.\nCounters\nApplying forced movement on a target that is being bounced with Firesnap Cookie will make them immediately hit the ground and stun the area underneath them. You can use this to cut a Cookie jump short with spells like Drow Ranger's Gust or Lich's Sinister Gaze.\nBoth the Lil' Shredder buff on Snapfire and the minus armor debuff can be removed with basic dispels.\nMost types of disables will cancel the Mortimer Kisses cast. Some exceptions that don't cancel the cast: Disruptor's Glimpse, Vengeful Spirit's Nether Swap, or any roots/leashes.\nOne notable long range Kiss-cancel is Sniper's Assassinate. Get vision with Shrapnel, then Assassinate her to end her Kiss cast.\nNyx Assassin can walk into any glob puddle, activate Spiked Carapace, and instantly cancel the Mortimer Kisses cast.\nThere is a minimum allowed range on Kiss targeting. If you walk into melee range of Snapfire, she can't get any Kisses on you.\nIf you're trying to escape from long range Kisses, activate a Smoke to potentially escape Snap's vision."

        "name": "Mars",
        "guide": "Tips\nSpear of Mars provides flying vision as it travels and the vision lingers around an impaled enemy.\nSpear of Mars does not ignore illusions, it'll skewer them just like a normal hero.\nOnly the primary target of the Spear that is skewered gets stunned. The knockback on other enemies in the path of the Spear does not count as a disable.\nClockwerk's Power Cogs, Tusk's Ice Shards, Drow Ranger's Agh's Shard Glacier, Nature's Prophet's Sprout, and obviously your own Arena of Blood's walls count as objects that you can pin an enemy to with your Spear to get the stun. Earthshaker's Fissure does not count as of this patch.\nIron Branch trees also count, but the collision with the Spear isn't very consistent.\nNo part of the Radiant (bottom) Rosh pit counts as walls to Spear stun an enemy to. They'll just fly right past the wall. Only the back wall of the Dire (top) Rosh pit will count as a wall.\nYou can pin people to Twin Gates with the Spear.\nYou can also pin people to Underlord's Fiend's Gate with Spear.\nThe very center of the Lotus Pool counts as a wall that you can Spear stun people to. Only the center works, though, not the outer Pool area.\nForced movement can shift enemies around after they get skewered, but as long as the Spear still connects to a wall/tree, the enemy will still get stunned wherever they are. God's Rebuke counts as forced movement, so if you're quick, you can Rebuke a target while they're flying back from your Spear to cancel the Spear movement.\nHowever, keep in mind that applying any forced movement during the Spear will also briefly remove the stun debuff from an enemy until the Spear hits a wall. So if you're against enemies with instant cast spells or items like BKB/Eul's, they will be able to activate the spell/item during the Rebuke bump.\nInvisible units can get Speared, but you'll only get true sight on the target if they get impaled on something.\nThe impact particle effect from God's Rebuke can indirectly show where an invisible unit is.\nGod's Rebuke's can't bump enemies out of Disruptor's Kinetic Field, but Spear of Mars will yeet enemies out of the Field.\nThe knockback on God's Rebuke does not count as a disable and will not cancel enemy channels.\nGod's Rebuke performs a true strike instant attack on all targets in the AoE. This means each target has a chance to proc/apply attack modifiers, excluding cleave. Just keep in mind that most chance based procs from items have an internal cooldown and can't proc multiple targets simultaneously.\nGod's Rebuke can kill enemy couriers.\nSince God's Rebuke includes a 'right click,' it'll break your Smoke if it damages a unit.\nBulwark only reduces damage from attacks and instant attacks, but not physical damage spells.\nWhen Bulwark is toggled on, any ranged attack projectile launched to a target in a cone behind Mars has a percentage chance to travel straight to Mars instead of their original intended targets. This also works against projectiles from Medusa's Split Shot or Gyrocopter's Flak Cannon.\nYou can also redirect attacks with active Bulwark by standing within 100 units of the ally being targeted. The angle of the source attack does not matter if you're this close.\nActive Bulwark will redirect attacks from towers, including the multishots from Glyphed towers.\nActive Bulwark will redirect attacks from ward-type units, like Shadow Shaman's Serpent Wards or Witch Doctor's Death Ward.\nActive Bulwark gives Mars phased movement allowing him to pass through other units.\nToggling Bulwark can prevent Rubick from stealing your better spells.\nYou can toggle Bulwark while channeling a TP.\nWhen Bulwark is toggled on, you don't have to turn to cast items. This includes items targetable on enemies, like Eul's, Force Staff, Urn of Shadows, etc.\nNormally, casting a TP scroll will turn your hero to the direction of the structure you're traveling to. But since you don't have to turn to cast items when Bulwark is on, you can also avoid turning to your TP target. This can be useful if you're escaping and TP'ing to fountain. Face your attackers, toggle Bulwark on, then channel the TP to benefit from Bulwark's damage reduction while TP'ing in the opposite direction.\nNot having to turn for items can be especially useful if you have a Blink and are getting Eul's combo'd and you have a way to mitigate the landing damage of the cyclone (like Pipe). While you're cycloned, activate the Pipe, shift+queue Bulwark's active, then shift+queue your Blink Dagger and you should be able to instantly Blink out without having to turn.\nAgh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers attack once per second. The one second interval is calculated only while Bulwark is toggled on. You can somewhat abuse this by toggling Bulwark on during the 'backswing' interval, then toggling off before the soldiers are about to attack. Then the next time you toggle them on, they'll attack immediately, and then reset again for another full second.\nAgh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers can proc any attack modifiers your hero has. They can also attack buildings.\nAgh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers will not attack if you are stunned or disarmed.\nAgh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers are actual units with actual vision. This means that if you can maneuver one of them into the Rosh pit or on a high ground, they can provide roughly 800 vision that your hero couldn't naturally see.\nThe knockback from Agh's Scepter Bulwark soldiers may shove enemies out of your Arena if you're pushing them around too close to the edge.\nIf you're quick fingered, you can cast Arena while an enemy is flying from your Spear and pin them to the Arena wall as it forms.\nArena of Blood blocks enemy attack projectiles from entering the ring. This includes attacks from towers or the fountain.\nIf a debuff immune ranged enemy is about to kill you during the Arena, weave in and out of the Arena walls. The enemy hero may be able to pass through the walls, but their attack projectiles still get blocked.\nRoshan can't pass through the Arena walls and will get stuck on the edge.\nHere are the rules of engagement when dealing with the Arena of Blood:\nEnemies can freely blink in or out of the Arena. You should initiate against Blink Dagger carriers by hitting them with God's Rebuke first to break their Dagger so they can't just Blink out of your Arena.\nEnemies with movement spells that provide invulnerability during travel (like Earth Spirit's Rolling Boulder, Faceless Void's Time Walk, Morphling's Waveform, Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning, Wind Waker's active cyclone) can freely pass through the Arena walls.\nDebuff immunity/BKB allows enemies to pass freely through the Arena walls.\nSpells that provide flying movement, unobstructed movement, or otherwise modify a hero's z-axis do not allow passage out of the Arena walls.\nHeroes can utilize forced movement spells to shove targets into your Arena, like with Earth Spirit's Boulder Smash or Keeper of the Light's Blinding Light, but they can't use those spells to take people out of the Arena.\nForce Staff cannot push enemies in or out of the Arena.\nPudge can Meat Hook enemy heroes in or out of the Arena. When Hooking them out, they'll still bump into the Arena wall, but Meat Hook always brings targets to the Hook location once it ends.\nEnemy Clockwerks can Hookshot into the Arena, but cannot Hookshot themselves out of the Arena. Either direction, he'll still get canceled by the wall soldier before he reaches his target.\nThe Arena wall soldiers will attack invisible units regardless of detection.\nThe wall soldier knockback is non-disabling, so God's Rebuking a TP'ing enemy into the wall won't cancel their channel.\nCounters\nI advise scrolling up and reading through the Arena rules to figure out what does and doesn't work to get out of it. Quick reference is blinks (Phantom Assassin's Phantom Strike, Riki's Blink Strike, actual Blinks), invulnerable movement spells (Faceless Void's Time Walk, Morphling's Waveform, Storm Spirit's Ball Lightning), and debuff immunity (Juggernaut's Blade Fury, Lifestealer's Rage, Omniknight's Repel, building BKB) allows you to pass through the Arena.\nBulwark can be disabled with Breaks.\nHeroes dealing high magic damage are invaluable since Bulwark only reduces right clicks.\nSpells can travel through the Arena of Blood, but ranged right click projectiles will be blocked by the wall.\nIf you have a Quelling Blade/Battle Fury or Tango, you can try to go for big plays by lining yourself up with a tree for him to Spear you against and then destroying the tree before the Spear connects.\nAfter Spear is used, Mars has no way to cancel TPs. Neither God's Rebuke nor Arena soldiers cancel channels."

        "guide": "Tips\nIf you want to be extremely annoying in lane, cancel the Starbreaker cast animation to mindgame enemies and bait them into getting complacent about dodging it. Be warned, however, you have to have quick fingers to cancel the animation.\nDawnbreaker will destroy trees as her hero moves into them during Starbreaker.\nYou do not have free pathing in Starbreaker, so you can't travel up or down cliffs during the spell.\nIf you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" option enabled, double tapping Starbreaker will cast the spell directly in front of where you're facing.\nOn-hit effects (like Basher, Maelstrom, or Desolator) will apply normally during Starbreaker attack swipes except for cleave.\nNeutral items that modify right clicks (like Enchanted Quiver or Mind Breaker) will work as expected and only affect the first target.\nEcho Sabre will apply its slow and be put on cooldown after the first swipe. Unfortunately, Starbreaker is already a 100% slow, so in reality the Echo Sabre proc is just wasted.\nActivating a Shadow Blade/Silver Edge will give you the backstab bonus, but also remove the invisibility as soon as a swipe connects on an enemy. If multiple heroes are hit during the same swipe, you'll only backstab the first hero you connect with.\nQuelling Blade damage does apply on creeps during Starbreaker.\nYou can cast items normally during Starbreaker. However, targeted items need to have their cast location be in front of you during the spell because Dawn can't turn during Starbreaker.\nYou can cast Force Staff or Harpoon mid-Starbreaker to get some forward movement while spinning.\nAfter the initial swipes go off, you can Blink Dagger forwards to instantly land on a target with the final swipe stun to surprise an enemy.\nYou can technically initiate a TP mid-Starbreaker if you're facing your TP location, but it won't complete because Dawnbreaker ministuns herself after the final swipe. That applies to all channeled spells/items cast during Starbreaker.\nStarbreaker attack swipes ignore disarms and have true strike.\nDespite providing debuff immunity, Agh's Shard Starbreaker does not apply a dispel on your hero.\nDebuff immunity ends if Agh's Shard Starbreaker gets interrupted.\nA side product of Agh's Shard giving you free movement during Starbreaker is that move speed buffs can make you faster during swipes.\nNote that free movement is not the same thing as free pathing. Agh's Shard Starbreaker does not allow you to traverse cliffs or move past obstacles.\nLuminosity can only gain one charge per Starbreaker swipe regardless of how many enemies get hit.\nWhile Celestial Hammer is out, you cannot cast Starbreaker or Solar Guardian.\nCelestial Hammer very briefly provides a small radius of vision where it lands, but not while the Hammer is flying.\nCelestial Hammer destroys trees in its path when flying or returning to Dawnbreaker.\nCelestial Hammer can damage enemies once while flying towards the destination and once again upon returning.\nNo matter how far the Celestial Hammer is, Dawnbreaker will only travel a maximum distance of the Hammer's cast range when Converging to it.\nBe aware that you can use Coverge with Celestial Hammer to travel up and down cliffs when initiating or escaping.\nYou can use Converge to escape a Disruptor's Kinetic Field.\nLuminosity is considered lifesteal, not healing. So Holy Locket heal amp does not increase the HP gain, but lifesteal amp from Sange does.\nThis includes the Luminosity AoE 'heal' on allies. That value is also calculated from how much you lifestealed.\nYou ideally want the first Starbreaker swipe to proc Luminosity so that the other swipes will quickly build up stacks again. Then you'll potentially get another Luminosity auto attack while they're stunned.\nEvery target hit in a Starbreaker swipe will proc Luminosity once it's charged. If you're trying to burst heal, gather as many units as possible so you get an AoE Luminosity from a Starbreaker swipe.\nLuminosity stacks last indefinitely and won't increase/proc when attacking buildings or ward targets.\nYou can hold ALT to see all your allies current HP under their top bar portraits. Useful if you want to keep your camera away from a fight, but want to make sure you can time Solar Guardian on an ally if they're about to die.\nYou can even cast Solar Guardian on an ally by clicking their top bar portrait when targeting the spell.\nYou can cast Solar Guardian on yourself.\nSolar Guardian does not heal Dawnbreaker even if she's in the AoE.\nYou cannot cast Solar Guardian on allies that are banished, but you can cast it on allies that are cycloned.\nYou can cast Solar Guardian on creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem. Technically, Elder Titan's Astral Spirit is also classed as a creep-hero but the cowards at Valve won't let you to cast Guardian on it.\nOnce you're in the air during Solar Guardian, you're completely banished off the map. You can't receive buffs or debuffs until you land.\nSolar Guardian's stun works on debuff immune/BKB'd enemies.\nDawnbreaker will always get the landing stun from Solar Guardian. Even if you're going to land inside an Enigma Black Hole or Faceless Void Chronosphere, you'll always land with the stun first.\nDawnbreaker's actual hero moves locations around the midpoint of a Solar Guardian cast. This is relevant if you have auras on your hero, because the auras won't be centered around the Solar Guardian AoE until your hero moves halfway through the cast.\nIf you're trying to escape, bear in mind that Solar Guardian's cast time is quicker than channeling a TP.\nCounters\nThe best way to deal with Starbreaker in lane is to just walk into her. It seems counterintuitive, but you're better off avoiding the spell by moving closer to her rather than running away.\nSilences cannot cancel a Starbreaker that is already in progress. Every other type of disable (stuns, sleeps, fears, etc) can, though.\nYou can cancel Dawnbreaker's Converge to her Hammer by stunning, cycloning, fearing, or applying any forced movement to her mid-flight.\nRoots/leashes can prevent Dawnbreaker from casting Converge, but they won't stop her if she's already flying to her Hammer.\nNyx Assassin can just walk into a Solar Guardian, activate Carapace, and immediately make Dawnbreaker very sad.\nSilencer can cast Global Silence on reaction to interrupt a Solar Guardian, but be aware that if you're too slow and she's already in the air, she's completely invulnerable and is going to land unsilenced.\nDon't underestimate the heal on Solar Guardian. It can be worth building a Spirit Vessel, Shiva's Guard, or Skadi to mitigate the survivability Dawn gives her allies.\nAncient Apparition's Ice Blast and Doom's Doom prevent any kind of healing."

        "name": "Marci",
        "guide": "Tips\nYou can cast Dispose on an ally's top bar portrait to easily target them. Useful if you're trying to save a specific target in a sea of summons or illusions in a chaotic team fight.\nIf an ally or enemy is affected by forced movement while flying in Dispose, they'll immediately drop to the ground and slow the AoE underneath them.\nYou can't Dispose units affected by Enigma's Black Hole or Faceless Void's Chronosphere.\nYou can use Dispose to cancel an enemy's channel because the throw counts as a stun.\nDispose will also cancel ally channels.\nDispose throw distance is slightly affected by the z-axis of the map. If you throw a unit uphill, they may not go as far, and if you throw a unit downhill, they'll go slightly further than a ground level Dispose.\nWhen farming lanes, ranged creeps are your best friends. If you have the mana, Rebound off your ranged creep into the enemy wave, then chuck the enemy ranged in with Dispose to quickly nuke a wave down.\nDispose destroys trees wherever the target unit lands.\nRebound destroys trees wherever you land.\nYour Rebound landing location is not perfectly in the center of the target AoE, but instead slightly closer to the direction you leapt from. Ideally, if you're trying to Dispose an enemy into your team after Rebounding, you may want to catch the enemy with the edge of the Rebound AoE so you have a good Dispose angle immediately after landing.\nRespect the z-axis when casting Rebound. If your Rebound trajectory arcs over a cliff, you may end up landing on the cliff instead of your targeted AoE.\nAlways be on the lookout for allies to Rebound off of when you're trying to escape.\nAgh's Shard Rebound allows you to jump off neutral creeps in addition to enemies.\nEven if the targeted unit you're Rebounding to dies mid-dash, you'll still leap off their corpse. Very metal.\nBe aware that targets can disjoint Rebound's initial dash. You'll run to wherever they were before they disjointed your Rebound and then suddenly stop. So warn allies if they're thinking about blinking or activating a Manta Style before you bounce off them.\nRebound's initial dash is stopped by barriers, like Disruptor's Kinetic Field, but the leap can get you out.\nSidekick can be cast on creep-heroes like Lone Druid's Spirit Bear, Visage's Familiars, or Warlock's Golem.\nSidekick damage works on denying attacks, but you don't get any lifesteal.\nEnemies cannot see Unleash pulses if your hero is in fog.\nYou can continue Unleash combos and get pulses on deny attacks.\nThis is extremely situational, but in theory you could plant a ward and immediately deny combo it to get a pulse. Potentially useful against ethereal, invisible, or fogged units or to maybe cancel a Blink Dagger.\nAgh's Scepter Unleash allows Marci's abilities to create pulses when Unleash is active.\nDispose releases a pulse at the target's location upon landing.\nRebound releases a pulse at Marci's location upon landing.\nSidekick releases a pulse at Marci's and the ally's location on cast.\nCounters\nRespect Dispose in lane. Marcis are always fishing for opportunities to yeet you into their tower.\nRebound takes some time to cast and the stun radius isn't that large. In lane, don't just mindlessly walk in one direction if you're expecting a Marci to Rebound on you. Dodge it like you would a Leshrac Split Earth or a Lina Light Strike Array.\nRoots/leashes prevent Marci from casting Rebound.\nThe only thing that can cancel a Rebound that's already mid-cast are sources of forced movement. Otherwise, she'll receive whatever stun/root/silence/taunt you put on her, but continue dashing and leaping.\nGhost Scepter and banishes can be useful at wasting her time while she's Unleashed."

        "guide": "Tips\nOnslaught movement can be canceled at any point using the 'stop' hotkey.\nIf you want a very short and quick Onslaught, don't use the spell hotkey to cancel the wind up animation. Instead, use your 'stop' hotkey to immediately cancel the wind up. This bypasses the mini-cooldown the spell goes on to prevent accidental mashing.\nIf you shift+queue Onslaught and a stop command during Pulverize, an enemy won't even be able to BKB in between the spells.\nYou can layer Agh's Shard Rock Throw on top for even MORE chain stunning.\nOnslaught will bump enemies and allies in your path. The bump does not disable allies nor cancel their channels.\nYou can use this bump to push allies out of things like Disruptor's Kinetic Field or Slark's Pounce leash.\nYou can slightly influence the direction of an Onslaught by right clicking where you want to steer it. It doesn't change your angle too much, but it's better than nothing.\nEnemies can hear all of your Onslaught sound effects, even through fog, if their camera is in the vicinity of your hero. Basically, if an enemy is in your Onslaught AoE, they'll definitely hear you starting the cast.\nOnslaught will freely path you over cliffs and trees. You'll destroy any trees in your way.\nYou can Onslaught along the edges of the map for a few seconds of high ground vision.\nYou can cast items without turning to the target during the wind up of Onslaught.\nYou can cast non-targeted spells and items at any point in Onslaught without canceling the charge. This means you can activate Trample at any point during Onslaught and keep moving.\nCasting targeting items will immediately cancel the charge.\nTrample destroys trees you walk over.\nTrample won't proc while you're being moved from Force Staff.\nTrample will proc a few times while spinning in a Eul's cyclone. Even more during a Wind Waker if you're moving around.\nThe \"Cannot be slowed or rooted during Trample\" talent can be activated while these debuffs are applied to you and your hero will ignore them, but it won't dispel the debuff.\nThe talent bypasses roots, but leashes won't be ignored.\nYou can activate Trample or Uproar while channeling, such as when channeling Onslaught, Pulverize, or a TP.\nYou gain Uproar stacks from damage applied by heroes or player owned summons.\nEven allied hero damage works. If you have an Oracle on your team, Purifying Flames will add Uproar stacks.\nWhile Uproar is active, you won't build new stacks.\nEach line from Agh's Scepter Uproar can damage an enemy, similar to Shadow Fiend's Requiem. So if you're standing right on top of someone with Trample or during Pulverize, they'll get hit by every line.\nAgh's Shard Rock Throw split fragments will travel in the opposite direction of your hero when the first Rock lands. It has nothing to do with the original direction you threw the first Rock. Therefore, if you blink while the first Rock is in the air, you can modify the angle of the fragmented rocks.\nAgh's Shard Rock Throw builds Uproar stacks for each hero hit by a Rock. It counts illusions and creep-heroes as valid targets to add Uproar stacks.\nYou can pollute the map with Agh's Shard Rocks by moving somewhere and shift+queueing Rock Throw on precisely the same spot you're walking to without moving your mouse at all. You'll throw a Rock that'll just vibrate in the air without ever touching the ground. Completely useless, but great at irritating people.\nPulverize ignores status resistance.\nCounters\nPrimal Beast can't cast Onslaught while rooted/leashed.\nIf he's already in the middle of the wind up animation for Onslaught, roots will cancel it. If leashed, he'll just run in place, but beware that he'll still have the stun AoE around him.\nOnslaught movement can be canceled by applying dispels on Primal while he's galloping. Spells like Enchantress's Enchant, Techies' Reactive Tazer explosion, Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge, or Nullifier can stop him in his tracks mid-Onslaught. These dispels have to be applied after he starts moving, though. They won't cancel while he's winding up Onslaught.\nMost disables can cancel Onslaught while Primal is moving and even during the wind up animation.\nEven Force Staff, Harpoon, and other sources of forced movement can end Onslaught prematurely.\nSilences won't cancel an Onslaught that's already started winding up.\nThe Uproar active buff can be dispelled off Primal Beast.\nYou can dispel the break debuff from Agh's Scepter Uproar, but new lines will immediately reapply it.\nPulverize is a channeled disable, so stunning or silencing Primal Beast during the channel will end the spell.\nLotus Orb prevents Primal Beast from casting Pulverize on a target without it getting canceled instantly.\nPrimal Beast will stop Pulverizing if he's affected by forced movement. So don't Force Staff your ally if they're getting their head smashed in, Force Primal instead.\nClockwerk makes life extremely unpleasant for Primal Beast with how often he can stun and interrupt Primal's spells."

Coordinate with an ally for BIG PLAYS.\nDead Shot's range is huge so you can use it to help stack camps from a distance.\nUse Dead Shot's fear to keep enemies stuck in The Calling AoE.\nIf you have the \"Double Tap Ability to Self Cast\" option enabled, double tapping The Calling will cast the spell on top of your hero.\nRevenants from The Calling will always travel counter-clockwise regardless of the angle or direction your hero is when you cast it.\nAll aspects of The Calling work on neutral units.\nThe attack speed slow from The Calling can be useful against Rosh.\nEnemies dying under Aegis (or Wraith King Reincarnation) will refresh The Calling duration and add a Revenant.\nAny Meepo, Arc Warden Tempest Double, Spirit Bear, or debuff immune/BKB'd enemy dying under The Calling will count as a hero death to refresh The Calling and add a Revenant.\nIllusions don't count as heroes to refresh The Calling.\nGunslinger will only proc on the main target if there are no secondary targets available.\nGunslinger attacks will never target ward-type units unless they're the primary unit and only unit available to Gunsling onto.\nGunslinger will prioritize nearby creeps if you're targeting a tower, but towers are the lowest priority to Gunsling onto when attacking creeps.\nGunslinger range is slightly higher than your base attack range and scales with attack range bonuses.\nGunslinger secondary hits are instant attacks that can proc attack modifiers and can miss due to evasion.\nPierce the Veil allows you to hit ethereal (Ghost Scepter, Pugna's Decrepify, Necrophos's Ghost Shroud) targets.\nYou can even hit Pugna's Nether Ward if he Decrepifies it.\nUnlike some other ethereal sources, the ethereal form of Pierce the Veil does not reduce your own magic resistance.\nYour Pierce the Veil attacks will interact with spell lifesteal and spell damage amplification/reduction.\nTraditional attack lifesteal, like from Satanic, will not work while in Pierce the Veil.\nAll other attack modifiers will work while in Pierce the Veil.\nBe careful when activating Pierce the Veil to take a Tormentor. The Tormentor will end up reflecting a ton of magic damage which may kill your teammates.\nActivating Pierce the Veil applies a basic dispel on your hero and disjoints any incoming projectiles.\nYou have phased movement during Pierce the Veil.\nYou can't hit buildings while in Pierce the Veil.\nYou can't interact with any structures on the map, really. You can't channel Twin Gates, Lotus Pools, Outposts, or Watchers while Pierce the Veil is active.\nEnemies need to die within 925 range of Muerta for Agh's Shard Pierce the Veil to build stacks.\nI am not going to test Agh's Scepter Parting Shot interactions.

If you're desperate for information, hit up my boy zzADRiANzz for sick Parting Shot tech.\nActually, I'll give you one. If you Parting Shot Clinkz, he can eat himself with Death Pact.\n\nNow I'm done.\nCounters\nTry not to be caught in between your creeps and Muerta if you're near her tower otherwise Dead Shot's fear may push you into tower attack range.\nDead Shot's targeted projectile can be disjointed by invis and blinks.\nYou only take damage when bumping into the ghosts from The Calling. The center of the aura doesn't deal any damage.\nGunslinger can be disabled by breaks like from Silver Edge or Viper's Viper Strike.\nRevenant's Brooch allows you to hit ethereal targets like Muerta in Pierce the Veil.\nPierce the Veil cannot be dispelled off Muerta."
