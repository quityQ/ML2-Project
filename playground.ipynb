      "LLaMA (Large Language Model Application) is a research project led by the AI researcher and writer, Jason Eisner. The primary goal of LLaMA is to develop a highly advanced language model that can generate human-like text based on a given prompt or topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "The name \"LLaMA\" comes from the idea of creating an application (MA) using large language models (LL). The project aims to push the boundaries of what is possible with AI-generated text, focusing on applications like storytelling, dialogue generation, and even creative writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of the key features of LLaMA include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **High-quality text generation**: The model can generate text that is coherent, well-structured, and engaging.\n",
      "2. **Control over style and tone**: Users can influence the tone, style, and language used in generated text to suit their preferences.\n",
      "3. **Conversational dialogue**: LLaMA can engage in conversations, responding to user input and adapting its responses based on context.\n",
      "\n",
      "The project is ongoing, with researchers continuously working to improve the model's capabilities and fine-tune its performance. While LLaMA is primarily a research initiative, it has the potential to have significant implications for various industries, such as entertainment, education, and customer service.\n",

      "Tips\n",
      "Blink into the trees! If you're getting ganked, always assume that there is someone behind you, waiting for you to Blink back into the lane/jungle to retreat. You have a stupid low cooldown on Blink. Blink into an isolated patch of trees, then watch four heroes suddenly materialize from the fog struggling to find you, then quietly continue Blinking along the treeline until you're sure you're safe. Chances are you'll have a Quelling Blade or Battle Fury to cut down trees and walk your way out anyway.\n",
      "Counterspell prevents single targeted spells from affecting you and it reflects the spell back at the original caster. All Linken's and Lotus Orb interactions are consistent with Counterspell's behavior. There are a few unique interactions to note, however:\n",
      "Certain spells can only be reflected by Counterspell on cast and don't do anything on projectile impact. Notable examples include Dazzle's Poison Touch and Grimstroke's Phantom's Embrace.\n",
      "Riki's Blink Strike and Phantom Assassin's Phantom Strike will be 'absorbed' by Counterspell. So their spell will go on cooldown and they won't come to you, but you won't reflect back to them.\n",
      "'Bouncing' spells can't be reflected unless you're the primary target, but Counterspell will still allow you to ignore a few of them once they bounce to you. Notable examples include Bounty Hunter's Shuriken Toss, Medusa's Mystic Snake, and Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask.\n",
      "Some AoE spells can be reflected by Counterspell if you are in the AoE. Notable examples include Alchemist's Unstable Concoction, Lion's Earth Spike, and Sand King's Burrowstrike. Note that Burrowstrike will make you swap positions with Sand King if you Counterspell him.\n",
      "If you attack a target that's Bane Nightmared with Counterspell on, you'll take it off the target and the enemy Bane will get Nightmared instead of you. Since you're considered the 'owner' of the Nightmare, you're also allowed to attack Bane without the Nightmare getting dispelled. Pretty funny.\n",
      "If Tiny Tossed you in the air on yourself and he's still standing next to you when you hit the ground, activating Counterspell will Toss him up in the air.\n",
      "Linken's Sphere will only trigger on your hero if Counterspell's shield isn't active.\n",
      "Rather than trying to perfectly time Counterspell when a projectile hits you, just force the issue. If you're escaping from an enemy who you think is trying to cast a spell on you, take them by surprise by walking towards them with Counterspell on and they may fire their spell straight into your shield.\n",
      "Left click on an enemy hero to check their mana pool before Mana Voiding them. You may be able to get a kill without doing any right clicking if you show up at the right time.\n",
      "Mana Break plays a slightly higher pitched sound on attacks when targets are below 50% of their max mana.\n",
      "While it's often tempting to spend Mana Void as a baller finishing move on a pick-off target, know that it's really not meant to be used like an Axe Culling Blade in the late game. The AoE damage can be significant when used on a out-of-mana target with a large mana pool and you never know if you may need the stun to cancel an enemy channel.\n",
      "That being said, it's okay for you to steal kills with Mana Void in the early/mid game. You do more with the gold than anyone else at that stage. The typical Anti-Mage team fight contribution is a two way street.\n",
      "Mana Void stuns everything in the AoE. If you're trying to stun an enemy who has a Linken's Sphere, consider Mana Voiding a creep next to them to bypass Linken's and stun them.\n",
      "If you ground target Agh's Scepter Blink Fragment from fog, you won't reveal yourself to the enemy who gets hit by it. If you directly target them, they'll get vision of you.\n",
      "This is true for any spell that has the option between ground and direct unit targeting. If you ever directly target an enemy unit, the enemy team will briefly get vision of your hero. If you ground target, you won't be revealed through fog.\n",
      "This is useless information, but the bonus damage from the passive Quell of Quelling Blade stacks with Battle Fury. Now that I mention it, the active also stacks and doesn't share a cooldown with Battle Fury allowing you to cut double the trees!\n",
      "An excellent hero to practice learning Tread switching on. Get in the rhythm of always tapping your Treads to INT before Blinking and then immediately turning them back to AGI. You'd be surprised at how much mana you save.\n",
      "Counters\n",
      "Shadow Demon is a notable counter against AM since the illusions created by Disruption will Mana Break him. Dark Seer's Wall of Replica and Terrorblade's Reflection are also ways to create illusions of an enemy Anti-Mage.\n",
      "Try not to stack disables when ganking AM. Stuns and silences are invaluable when you're trying to kill him, but you need to stagger them appropriately, otherwise he'll blink out.\n",
      "The best players will not only stagger disables, but wait for the middle of AM's 0.4s cast animation on Blink to disable him.\n",
      "Roots/leashes prevent Anti-Mage from casting Blink.\n",
      "Watch his Blink animation to determine the direction that he Blinks in. The particle 'trail' always floats in the direction that he traveled.\n",
      "Harpoon's active is undisjointable. If you're trying to catch an escaping Anti-Mage, try timing Harpoon during his Blink animation and the projectile will follow and drag him right back to you. This is less reliable in melee range because you need the Blink to happen before the Harpoon projectile connects.\n",
      "Try baiting Counterspell by canceling cast animations of single targeted spells. The Counterspell buff doesn't last that long and skittish Anti-Mages may be too trigger happy with activating the shield. Same concept as baiting an enemy Slark into casting Dark Pact too early.\n",
      "AM's Mana Break passive and magic resistance from Counterspell's passive can be broken by Silver Edge and other sources of Break.\n",
      "Counterspell's active can be dispelled. Not really too useful since most dispels are targeted spells that'll get blocked by Counterspell anyway, but handy to know with Nullifier or Shadow Demon's Demonic Purge.\n",
      "A Ghost Scepter can save your life in the late game as a support.\n",
      "Don't stand near allies who are out of mana in the late game. They're a mana bomb waiting for AM to Mana Void detonate their ass.\n"
