      "Sand King, also known as Brock, is a powerful melee carry hero in Dota 2. Here's a general guide on how to play him effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Early Game:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Start by harassing the enemy creeps and denying them gold and experience.\n",
      "2. Focus on last-hitting creeps to get as much gold and experience as possible.\n",
      "3. Try to stay near your tower, especially in the early game, to avoid taking unnecessary damage.\n",
      "4. As you accumulate gold and experience, start to buy basic items such as Boots of Speed, Belt of Strength, and a small amount of armor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Mid Game:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Continue to last-hit creeps and deny enemy towers.\n",
      "2. Start buying more expensive items, such as Linken's Sphere, Vanguard, and a damage dealing item like Battle Fury or Skewer.\n",
      "3. Use your Sand Storm ability to scout out the enemy team's position, disrupt their movements, and set up ambushes for your teammates.\n",
      "4. Try to stay near the battle and use your Burrow ability to get close to enemy heroes and deal damage while they're trying to attack you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Late Game:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Focus on farming gold and experience by killing enemy heroes and denying creeps.\n",
      "2. Use your Sand Storm to zone out enemy heroes, preventing them from getting too close to your allies or objectives.\n",
      "3. Set up ambushes with your Burrow ability to take out enemy heroes who are trying to push lanes or defend objectives.\n",
      "4. Try to stay near the battle and use your Sand Warden ability to deal damage to enemy heroes while they're trying to attack you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**General Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Keep an eye on your minimap at all times to track enemy movements and set up ambushes.\n",
      "2. Use your abilities wisely, as Sand King's cooldowns can be quite long.\n",
      "3. Stay mobile and don't stay in one spot for too long, as this makes you vulnerable to ganks and ambushes.\n",
      "4. Communicate with your team about the enemy position and objective takes, and set up strategies together.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Item Builds:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some general item builds that can help you play Sand King effectively:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Physical Damage Build:** Start with Boots of Speed, then buy Belt of Strength, Vanguard, Battle Fury, Skewer, and Linken's Sphere.\n",
      "2. **Supportive Build:** Start with Boots of Speed, then buy Belt of Strength, Vanguard, Linken's Sphere, and a supportive item like Guardian Greaves or Heaven's Halberd.\n",
      "3. **Aggressive Build:** Start with Boots of Speed, then buy Belt of Strength, Vanguard, Battle Fury, Skewer, and a damage dealing item like Butterfly or Mask of Madness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to adapt your playstyle and item builds based on the game situation and your team's needs. Happy gaming!\n"
